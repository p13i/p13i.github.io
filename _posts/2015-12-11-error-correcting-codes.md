# Introduction to Coding Theory

## A practical example of error correction

How is it that a CD with so many scratches on it can still
be played continuously with few audible errors? Why is it
that a QR-code read incorrectly can still reveal the right
information?

In other words, how can a CD-player or QR-code reader take a
data stream with so many errors and correct most of them?
This is where error correcting codes (a topic within Coding
Theory) come into play.

## Overview of error detection

In communications over noisy channels, like radio
communications or the reading of a CD[^1], the data is often
not received as intended.

Suppose that I intend to send the following message to a
friend through a noisy channel: `Hi!` [^2] This string is
equivalent to the bits: `010010000110100100100001`

However, my friend may receive this message as corrupted [in ASCII](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-string.html). 
Flipped bits are marked in $\textcolor{red}{\verb|red|}$.

<p class="center">
$$\textcolor{red}{1}10010\textcolor{red}{1}00110100\textcolor{red}{1}001
\textcolor{red}{1}0001 \longleftrightarrow \verb!Êi1!$$
</p>

Converting this transmitted message back to a string doesn’t
even resemble a word! Over noisy mediums, error rates, like
one-in-six ratio as in the example, are very common. Using
check bits, however, we can devise of a simple way to detect
an error (but not correct it).

Suppose that I send a message composed of three bits and a
_parity bit_ which is calculated by adding all the previous
bits in the binary field $$\textbf{B} = \{0, 1\}$$:

<p class="center">
    $$\verb|Message:| 011$$
</p>
<p class="center">
    $$\verb|Parity bit:| \textcolor{blue}{0 + 1 + 1 = 0} \verb| in | \textbf{B}$$
</p>
<p class="center">
    $$\verb|Final message:| 011\textcolor{blue}{0}$$
</p>

Such a scheme can detect only one error:
Suppose that the message $$0100$$ is
received, then the receiver can perform
a simple calculation to see that the
number of $$1$$s in the first three bits
is congruent to the parity bit in **B**.
However, this particular scheme cannot
detect two errors because the parity bit
would not help in detecting an
error[^3]. The recipient of the data can
only ask for a re-transmission in this
scheme, an expensive and sometimes
infeasible task.

With certain modifications,
augmentations, and more complex
calculations, schemes based solely on
parity bits can detect a great deal of
errors. Generally, the _information
rate_ for parity bit schemes is
$$R:=\frac{n - 1}{n}$$ where $$n$$ is
the length of the message[^4]. However,
this high information rate comes at the
cost of not detecting a great deal of
possible errors. These types of
error-detecting schemes are widely
implemented in ISBN numbers, bar-code
scanners, and other noise-prone
applications where re-scanning is a
viable option.

## Overview of error correction

In some situations, like reading a CD or
in QR codes, detecting an error is
simply not a viable choice as a
corrupted bit cannot just be labeled as
incorrect and subsequently discarded as
the information may be vital. Here,
error **correction** is important.

A simple error **correction** scheme is
to simply append multiple copies of the
original message and transmit it. For
example, I can encode a message $$011$$
as $$011, 011, 011$$ and transmit
$$011011011$$. Then if a friend receives

$$
011\textcolor{red}{10}1011 = 011,
\textcolor{red}{10}1, 011$$ he/she can
take the majority-occurring message
$$(011)$$ as the actual message and use
it. Here the error correction and
detection scheme corrects two errors but
at the expense of more transmitted data.
The *information rate* for such a scheme
is $$R = \frac{1}{3}$$, a very
inefficient mechanism.

Defining Coding Theory
----------------------

Coding Theory deals with the creation
and analysis of efficient
error-correction schemes to ensure that
messages transmitted over noisy channels
are properly received.

Further, Coding Theory aims to find the
optimal balance of effectiveness and
efficiency of error-correcting codes in
various applications. In other words,
Coding Theory aims to balance a high
*information rate* with a high *error
correction rate*. A message is

Finally, I include a useful graphic
which outlines the procedure of error
correction across noisy channels. A
message is encoded into a codeword,
transmitted across a noisy channel, and
then decoded and corrected by the
recipient.

In this paper, I hope to effectively
outline the use of
**Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH)
codes** which form a class of cyclic
error-correcting codes constructed in
finite fields.

Preliminaries to and definitions for
discussing BCH codes
========================================

In the examples used in this paper, I
will discuss the Galois field containing
16 elements notated as
$$\textbf{GF}(16)$$.

Code words and Hamming distances
----------------------------------------

Let’s first define some key words and concepts:

If $$A$$ is an alphabet (containing $$q$$ symbols), then an *A-word* with length $$n$$ is
denoted as $$A^n$$ meaning that it contains $$n$$ elements from $$A$$. For
example, in the set of alphabetic characters
$$A = \{a, b, \cdots, z\}$$, the *A-word* $$\verb|"hello"|$$ is denoted
as $$A^5$$.

An *$$(n, m)$$-block code $$C$$* over the alphabet $$A$$ of size $$q$$ contains exactly $$q^m$$ *code
words* in $$A^n$$. The set of $$q^m$$ elements in $$A^n$$ consists of all
the *code words* for a message of length $$n$$ in the alphabet $$A$$.

We will see that the field of code words defined in finite fields have
special properties that would allow us to recover a corrupted message
$$m$$. In order encode some message $$m$$, we use a bijective[^5] encoder
$$E$$ to map some $$m \in A^m$$ to the set of code words $$C$$ which have
special properties as we will see.

We indulge in one more definition:

The Hamming distance

:   between two code words in $$u = (u_1, \ldots, u_n) \in A$$ and
    $$v = (v_1, \ldots, v_n) \in A$$ is a measure of how much $$u$$ and $$v$$
    differ[^6]. This distance is defined as the number of positions $$i$$
    where $$u_i \neq v_i$$. In other words, the Hamming distance is a
    measure of how different two words are. For example, the distance
    between the vectors $$\verb|hello|$$ and $$\verb|hi___|$$ in the
    alphabet set $$A$$ is 4 because the two vectors differ in value in
    four analougous locations.

Similarly, the *minimum distance* of the set $$C$$ is smallest Hamming
distance between any distinct pair of vectors in $$C$$. The minimum
distance is thus a measure of how “close” any two words are in a set of
code words; the lower the minimum distance, the closer two words in the
set $$C$$ are. A code with a *minimum Hamming distance of $$d$$* can correct
up to $$d-1$$ errors in a code word. Usually, the set of code words $$C$$ is
designed to have a **minimum Hamming distance**

In error-correction schemes, when receiving a message vector in a noisy
channel, say $$t = (t_1, \ldots, t_n)$$, we are looking in the set of
possible code words $$C$$ to see what vector $$v$$ in $$C$$ has the smallest
Hamming distance to $$t$$. Then, this vector $$v$$ is likely to be our
intended message vector. In other words, we are trying to see what the
message $$t$$ is most likely trying to represent from $$C$$.

Finite/Galois Fields
--------------------

Alphabets used in error-correction schemes are usually constrained to
$$256$$ bits because they can represent all the common characters used in
electronic communications. This leads to using a finite field of $$256$$
elements. Here, we give a more formal definition of finite fields.

The finite field $$\mathbb{F}_q$$ contains $$q$$ elements and the standard
arithmetic[^7] is constrained to this set of $$q$$ elements. $$\mathbb{F}$$
can also be considered a ring so $$\mathbb{F}[x]$$ is the set of
polynomials over $$\mathbb{F}$$. Arithmetic in $$\mathbb{F}_n[x]$$ can
performed under a polynomial modulo and is denoted as
$$\mathbb{F}_n[x]/f(x)$$ for some irreducible[^8] polynomial $$f(x)$$ that
divides $$(x^n - 1)$$.

For the purposes of this paper, we will consider four bits as a single
unit to deal with burst errors which tend to corrupt short and
continuous segments of a code. As such, we will want to consider fields
of size $$2^4 = 16$$ as there are two elements in the alphabet
$$\mathbb{B} = \{0, 1\}$$ and the code word has length $$4$$. As such, our
finite field will can be denoted as
$$\mathbb{B}_4[x]/f(x) = \textbf{GF}(16)$$.

We cannot use integers in our construction of our finite field as they
do not satisfy the cancellation law[^9] under non-prime modulo. So, we
must use polynomials because they satisfy the required arithmetic
properties.

Polynomials in finite fields
----------------------------

Because our field is $$\mathbb{B}_4[x]$$, we are constrained to using
binary coefficients to describe our polynomials. From binary strings, we
can easily represent polynomials in $$\pmod{16}$$. For example:
$$1 \times x^3 + 0 \times x^2 + 1 \times x^1 + 1 \times x^0 = x^3 + x + 1 \leftrightarrow 1011 \leftrightarrow 8 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 13$$
Polynomial addition is the same as addition over $$\mathbb{B}$$. For
example, adding $$101 \leftrightarrow x^2 + 1$$ and
$$011 \leftrightarrow x + 1$$ results in
$$x^2 + x + (1 + 1) = x^2 + x \leftrightarrow 110 $$. You may, correctly
note that this resembles an $$\verb|XOR|$$ operation.

Polynomial multiplication is a little more involved and is covered in
more detail soon.

Constructing a finite field with polynomials
--------------------------------------------

We have seen that using composite numbers $$c$$ in
$$\mathbb{Z}/c\mathbb{Z}$$ does not allow the set of integers
$$\{0, \ldots, c-1\}$$ to satisfy the cancellation law. Using numbers like
16 as the modulus for a finite field leads to results like
$$4 \times 4 \equiv 16 \equiv 0$$ which are troubling to finite fields.
This is why we chose polynomials as our arithmetic “basis” for math in
the finite field $$\mathbb{B}_4[x]/f(x)$$.

Thus, for the construction of a finite field, other than $$\mathbb{F}_p$$
for a prime $$p$$, we must choose polynomials $$g(x)$$ in $$\mathbb{F}_n[x]$$
that are *irreducible*[^10] factors of $$x^n - 1$$. One such factor of
$$x^{16} - 1$$ in **GF**(16) is $$g(x) = x^4 + x^3 + 1$$ and will be used to
construct a finite field below.

To construct the finite field $$\textbf{GF}(16)$$ using our generator
polynomial $$x^4 + x^3 + 1$$, we must first observe that $$x^4 = x^3 + 1$$
because coefficients of $$-1 \equiv 1$$ in $$\mathbb{B}$$. The finite field
itself is found by each possible binary polynomial under degree of $$4$$.
The set of possible polynomials each representing an integer from $$0$$ to
$$16$$ is listed below in abbreviated form[^11].

     **Polynomial**      **Binary**   **Decimal**
  --------------------- ------------ -------------
            0               0000           0
            1               0001           1
           $$x$$              0010           2
         $$x + 1$$            0011           3
          $$x^2$$             0100           4
        $$x^2 + 1$$           0101           5
      $$x^2 + x + 1$$         0111           6
        $$\cdots$$          $$\cdots$$     $$\cdots$$
   $$x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$$      1111          15

Now, to actually construct the field, we compute a table by multiplying
the polynomial representations of each binary number from the rows and
columns together to form a cell:

              0001   0010          0100   $$\cdots$$     1111
  ---------- ------ ------ ------ ------ ---------- ----------
     0001     0001   0010   0011   0100   $$\cdots$$     1111
                     0100          1000   $$\cdots$$     0111
     0011                   0101   1100   $$\cdots$$     1000
     0100                          1001   $$\cdots$$     1110
   $$\cdots$$                               $$\ddots$$   $$\vdots$$
     1111                                              0011

For example, to compute $$2 \times 3 \leftrightarrow 0010 \times 0011$$,
we compute the product of the polynomials:
$$(x) \times (x + 1) = x^2 + x \equiv x^2 + x \leftrightarrow \textcolor{green}{\textbf{0110}}$$
For another example, we compute $$1111 \times 0010$$:
$$(x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) \times (x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x$$ Using the fact
that $$x^4 = x^3 + 1$$ in $$\mathbb{B}$$ we **must** further reduce this
polynomial so it exists in $$\textbf{GF}(16)$$ because $$x^4$$ is not
defined in the field. $$\begin{aligned}
                x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x &= (x^3 + 1) + x^3 + x^2 + x\\
                    &= (x^3 + x^3) + x^2 + x + 1 \\
                    &= x^2 + x + 1 \leftrightarrow 0111 \text{  } \checkmark \\
                \end{aligned}$$ Below is a completed table (in base 10)
based on the primitive, generator polynomial $$x^4 + x^3 + 1$$ (Figure
\[mult\]).

Primitive elements in **GF**(16)
--------------------------------

Similar to a primitive root for a prime number, a primitive element in a
finite field can generate all elements of a field in some permutation.
In other words, $$\alpha \in \textbf{GF}(n)$$ is a primitive element if
the set $$\{a^0, a^1, \ldots, a^{n-1}\}$$ is a permutation of
$$\{1, 2, \ldots, n - 1\}$$.

For the field **GF**(16), $$\alpha = 2$$ is a primitive element because
all powers of $$\alpha$$ up to $$15$$ serve as a permutation of the set
$$\{1, 2, \ldots, n - 1\}$$. Using the multiplication table in Figure
\[mult\], we can easily verify this fact.

Overview of BCH
---------------

To develop a BCH code, we use all of the knowledge we have outlined
above. Given a binary message expressed as a polynomial called $$u(x)$$,
we can map it to an encoded code word $$c(x)$$ that lies in the set of
valid BCH code words[^12]. We then convert $$c(x)$$ to binary and transmit
across a noisy channel.

The receiver will then perform various polynomial operations, calculate
syndromes (yet to be discussed), and linear algebra row-reduction to
eventually calculate where the corrupted bits are.

Encoding in BCH
===============

To illustrate the BCH encoding and decoding procedures, we will use the
example of a triple-error correcting $$(15, 5, 7)$$BCH code in the
**GF**$$(16)$$ based on the primitive[^13] polynomial $$x^4 + x + 1$$[^14].

First, let us clarify what a $$(15, 5, 7)$$BCH code is:

The $$15$$ represents

:   the size of the binary message transmitted. The size of a message is
    limited by the size of the finite field we are using. In this case,
    we are using **GF**$$(16)$$ so the size of our message is limited to
    $$16 - 1 = 15$$. This value for $$15$$ is also directly related to the
    maximal power of a polynomial code word as we will soon see.

The $$5$$ represents

:   the number of information bits that can be transmitted.

The $$7$$ represents

:   the number of check bits needed to correct the $$3$$ errors we expect
    to introduce to our $$15$$ bit overall message. The *designed minimum
    distance* in this code is $$7$$ which is a requirement to correct $$3$$
    errors[^15].

Primitive elements and minimal polynomials in **GF**(16)
--------------------------------------------------------

Now, given a primitive element $$\alpha$$, we can find various minimal
polynomials[^16] $$\phi_j(x)$$ for each power of $$\alpha$$ given below.

                     Powers of $$\alpha$$                              Minimal polynomial
  -------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------
        $$\{\alpha, \alpha^2, \alpha^ 4, \alpha^8 \}$$              $$\phi_1(x) = x^4 + x + 1$$
      $$\{\alpha^3, \alpha^6, \alpha^9, \alpha^{12} \}$$      $$\phi_3(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$$
                $$\{\alpha^5, \alpha^{10}\}$$                       $$\phi_5(x) = x^2 + x + 1$$
   $$\{\alpha^7, \alpha^{11}, \alpha^{13}, \alpha^{14} \}$$        $$\phi_7(x) = x^4 + x^3 + 1$$

Note that each power $$i$$ of $$\alpha$$ (i.e. $$\alpha^i$$) is a multiple of
the corresponding minimal polynomial function $$\phi_j(x)$$.

Finding a generator polynomial g(x)
-----------------------------------

Now, we must construct our generator function $$g(x)$$ that will aid in
creating our BCH code word. We find $$g(x)$$ as such (using our table
above). We find the LCM of three minimal polynomials because we are
trying to correct three errors. $$\begin{aligned}
             g(x) &= LCM\{\phi_1(x), \phi_3(x), \phi_5(x)\} \\
                  &= (x^4 + x + 1) (x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) (x^2 + x + 1) \\
                  &= x^{10} + x^8 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1 \\
             \end{aligned}
$$

Now, we have finally established that the polynomial
$$g(x) = x^{10} + x^8 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1$$ can correct three
errors in a $$(15, \textbf{\underline{5}}, 7)$$ BCH code.

## Encoding our message into a codeword of BCH

Next, suppose that we would like to send a message $$m(x)$$. We can
express our \*\*\*\* message in equivalent forms:
$$m: 10110 \leftrightarrow m(x) = 1\cdot x^4 + 0\cdot x^3 + 1\cdot x^2 + 1\cdot x^1 + 0\cdot x^0 = x^4 + x^2 + x$$
Now, we must find our transmitted word $$t(x)$$:

1.  First, we find the parity bits polynomial $$b(x)$$. So, we must find
    the residue of $$x^{10} \cdot m(x)$$ in the **GF**$$(16)$$ based on the
    primitive polynomial $$x^4 + x + 1$$.

    In this case, we operate under $$\pmod{g(x)}$$. Our final expression
    is evaluated as such[^17]: $$\begin{aligned}
                            b(x) = x^{10} \cdot m(x) &= x^{10} \cdot (x^4 + x^2 + x) \\
                                &= x^{14} + x^{12} + x^{11}\\
                                &\equiv -2 x^9-x^8-2 x^6-2 x^5-x^4-x^3-x^2-x \pmod{g(x)} \\
                                &\equiv x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x \pmod{g(x)}
                        \end{aligned}$$

2.  Second, we find $$t(x)$$ by adding $$m(x) \cdot x^{10}$$ and $$b(x)$$:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
                        t(x) &= m(x) \cdot x^{10} + b(x) \\
                        &= (x^4 + x^2 + x) \cdot x^{10} + (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x) \\
                        &=x^{14} + x^{12} + x^{11} + x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x \\
                        & \leftrightarrow t: 101100100011110
                    \end{aligned}$$ Now, suppose we have transmitted the
    code word $$t$$. In transmission over a noisy channel, the error
    vector $$e: 001000001000001$$ is introduced to the transmission $$t$$.
    Adding the polynomials $$t(x)$$ and $$e(x) = x^{12} + x^6 + 1$$ we
    find the vector/polynomial $$r(x)$$ received is[^18].
    $$\begin{aligned}
                    r(x) &= t(x) + e(x) \\
                    &= (x^{14} + x^{12} + x^{11} + x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x) + (x^{12} + x^6 + 1) \\
                    &= x^{14} + x^{11} + x^8 + x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 \\
                    & \leftrightarrow 100100101011111 \\
                \end{aligned}
    $$

# Decoding and error correction in BCH

## Structure of BCH cyclic codes

Before delving in the decoding and error correction of our sample BCH
code, we should discuss the structure of these codes.

BCH codes are cyclic codes that are constructed by specifying the zeros
of their generator polynomials ($$g(x)$$ in our case). BCH generator
polynomials have a special property that the polynomial’s roots are
consecutive. Namely, the generator polynomial $$g(x)$$ has $$2t_d$$
consecutive roots
$$\alpha^b, \alpha^{b+1}, \ldots, \alpha^{b + 2t_d - 1}$$ where $$\alpha$$
is a primitive element and $$t_d$$ is the number errors that the BCH code
can correct. This fact arises from the fact that BCH codes have a
minimum _designed minimum Hamming distance_ of $$2t_d + 1$$.

## Decoding BCH codes

To decode binary codes in BCH, we must use the elements of **GF**(16) to
number the positions of a codeword. For a vector $$r$$ or length $$n$$, the
numbering is illustrated as such:

---

    values     $$r_o$$    $$r_1$$     $$\ldots$$     $$r_{n-1}$$

positions $$1$$ $$\alpha$$ $$\ldots$$ $$\alpha^{n-1}$$

---

In **GF**(16) arithmetic, we can find the positions of the errors
(bottom row of the table above) by solving a set of equations. These
equations can be found from the error polynomial $$e(x)$$ and the zeros of
the code $$a^j$$ for $$b \leq j \leq b + 2t_d - 1$$.

Let $$r(x) = m(x) + e(x)$$ represent the polynomial associated with a
received codeword where the error polynomial is defined as
$$e(x) = e_{j_i}x^{j_i} + \cdots + e_{j_v}x^{j_v}$$ for $$v \leq t_d$$ is
the number of errors. The sets $$\{e_{j_1}, \ldots, e_{j_v}\}$$ and
$$\{\alpha^{j_1}, \ldots, \alpha^{j_v}$$ are known as the _error values_
and _error positions_ respectively where $$e_j \in \mathbb{B} = \{0, 1\}$$
for binary BCH codes and $$\alpha \in \textbf{GF}(16)$$[^19].

We can then calculate syndrome values as such by evaluating $$r(x)$$ at
each of the zeros of the code (which we have established to be powers of
$$\alpha$$): $$\begin{aligned}
                    S_1 &= r(\alpha^b) \\
                    S_2 &= r(\alpha^{b+1}) \\
                    & \vdots \\
                    S_{2t_d} &= r(\alpha^{b+2t_d -1}) \\
                \end{aligned}$$

Then we can define our _error locater polynomial_ as:
$$\sigma(x) = \prod_{l=1}^{v} (1 + a^{j_l}x) = 1 + \sigma_1x + \cdots + \sigma_v x^v$$

Finally, the roots of this polynomial are equivalent to the roots of the
_inverses_ of the error locations in $$r(x)$$. Finally, we can make the
following relation between the coefficients of $$\sigma(x)$$ and the
syndromes as such.

$$
\left( \begin{array}{c}
                S_{v+1} \\
                S_{v+2} \\
                \vdots \\
                S_{2v} \end{array} \right)
                = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
                S_1 & S_2 & \cdots &S_v \\
                S_2 & S_3 & \cdots &S_{v+1} \\
                \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
                S_v & S_{v+1} & \cdots &S_{2v-1} \\
                \end{array} \right)
                \left( \begin{array}{c}
                \sigma_{v} \\
                \sigma_{v-1} \\
                \vdots \\
                \sigma_{1} \end{array} \right)
$$

Solving this matrix for the $$\sigma$$
vector will give us the coefficients in
the _error locater polynomial_
$$\sigma(x)$$. This matrix is also
referred to as the _key equation_. There
are multiple algorithms to solve for the
$$\sigma$$ vector:

<span>a</span><span> </span>

Euclidean algorithm

Berlekamp-Massey algorithm (BMA)

The Peterson-–Gorenstein–-Zierler (PGZ) decoder

In this example, we will use the PGZ decoder.

## Continuing our example...

Now, the binary message
$$r: 10\textcolor{red}{0}10010\textcolor{red}{1}01111\textcolor{red}{1}$$
is received and the recipient proceeds to determine the and correct the
errors.

The recipient must first calculate values known as syndromes by
evaluating the recevied message polynomial $$r(x)$$ for corresponding
powers of the primitive element $$\alpha \in \textbf{GF}(16)$$. The
syndromes are calculated as such using the Power/Vector table provided
in the Appendix:[^20] $$\begin{aligned}
                S_1 &= r(\alpha^1) = \alpha^{14} + \alpha^{11} + \alpha^8 + \alpha^6 +  \alpha^4 + \alpha^3 + \alpha^2 + \alpha^1 + \alpha^0 = \alpha \\
                S_2 &= {S_1}^2 = \alpha^2 \\
                S_3 &= r(\alpha^3) = {\alpha^3}^{14} + {\alpha^3}^{11} + {\alpha^3}^8 + {\alpha^3}^6 + {\alpha^3}^4 + {\alpha^3}^3 + {\alpha^3}^2 + {\alpha^3}^1 + {\alpha^3}^0 = \alpha^8\\
                S_4 &= {S_2}^2 = \alpha^4 \\
                S_5 &= r(\alpha^5) = {\alpha^5}^{14} + {\alpha^5}^{11} + {\alpha^5}^8 + {\alpha^5}^6 + {\alpha^5}^4 + {\alpha^5}^3 + {\alpha^5}^2 + {\alpha^5}^1 + {\alpha^5}^0 = 1 \\
                S_6 &= {S_3}^2 = \alpha \\
            \end{aligned}$$

Restating our findings: $$\begin{aligned}
             S_1 &= \alpha \\
             S_2 &= \alpha^2 \\
             S_3 & = \alpha^8 \\
             S_4 & = \alpha^4 \\
             S_5 &= 1 \\
             S_6 & = \alpha \\
             \end{aligned}$$

Now, knowing the six syndrome values for the received message $$r$$, we
can proceed to use the Peterson–-Gorenstein–-Zierler algorithm to find
the error locations of $$r$$.

## The Peterson-–Gorenstein–-Zierler (PGZ) decoder

The decoding problem with BCH is that the number of errors in a message
$$r$$ are unknown to a recipient.

The PGZ process begins by filling the matrix from prior with values that
we know for $$v = 3$$ representing the three number of errors we can
correct: $$\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
            S_1 & S_2 & \cdots &S_v \\
            S_2 & S_3 & \cdots &S_{v+1} \\
            \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
            S_v & S_{v+1} & \cdots &S_{2v-1} \\
            \end{array} \right)
            = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
            S_1 & S_2 &S_3 \\
            S_2 & S_3 & S_{4} \\
            S_3 & S_{4} & S_{5} \\
            \end{array} \right)
            = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
            \alpha & \alpha^2 & \alpha^8 \\
            \alpha^2 & \alpha^8 & \alpha^4 \\
            \alpha^8 & \alpha^4 & 1 \\
            \end{array} \right)$$

Because the $$\sigma_i$$ values below are the inverses of the error
positions, we must find the solution to the matrix equation:

$$
\left( \begin{array}{c}
            \alpha^4 \\
            1 \\
            \alpha \end{array} \right)
            = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
            \alpha & \alpha^2 & \alpha^8 \\
            \alpha^2 & \alpha^8 & \alpha^4 \\
            \alpha^8 & \alpha^4 & 1 \\
            \end{array} \right)
            \left( \begin{array}{c}
            \sigma_{3} \\
            \sigma_{2} \\
            \sigma_{1} \end{array} \right)
$$

Finding a solution for the $$\sigma$$ vector is equivalent to seeing if
$$\left( \begin{array}{ccc} \alpha & \alpha^2 & \alpha^8 \\ \alpha^2 & \alpha^8 & \alpha^4 \\ \alpha^8 & \alpha^4 & 1 \\ \end{array} \right)$$
is invertible. This is equivalent to the matrix having a non-zero
determinant[^21].

Let us calculate this determinant:

$$
\begin{aligned}
                 \text{det} \left( \begin{array}{ccc} \alpha & \alpha^2 & \alpha^8 \\ \alpha^2 & \alpha^8 & \alpha^4 \\ \alpha^8 & \alpha^4 & 1 \\ \end{array} \right)
                     &= \alpha(\alpha^8 + \alpha^8) + \alpha^2 (\alpha^2 + \alpha^{12}) + \alpha^8 (\alpha^6 + \alpha) \\
                     &= \alpha^{2+7} + \alpha^{8+11} \\
                     &= \alpha^{14}
             \end{aligned}
$$

Because the determinant of the matrix is non-zero, then the matrix
equation $$\left( \begin{array}{c}
            \alpha^4 \\
            1 \\
            \alpha \end{array} \right)
            = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
            \alpha & \alpha^2 & \alpha^8 \\
            \alpha^2 & \alpha^8 & \alpha^4 \\
            \alpha^8 & \alpha^4 & 1 \\
            \end{array} \right)
            \left( \begin{array}{c}
            \sigma_{3} \\
            \sigma_{2} \\
            \sigma_{1} \end{array} \right)$$ must have a solution for
the $$\sigma$$ vector. Through a multitude of methods, we can solve the
matrix equation above for the $$\sigma$$ vector. Any such valid
calculation (involving inverses and matrix multiplication[^22] reveals
the following vector:

$$
\left( \begin{array}{c}
            \sigma_{3} \\
            \sigma_{2} \\
            \sigma_{1} \end{array} \right)
            = \left( \begin{array}{c}
            \alpha^3 \\
            \alpha^7 \\
            \alpha \end{array} \right)
$$

It follows by our definition of the _error locater polynomial_ that:
$$\sigma(x) = \alpha^3 x^3 + \alpha^7 x^2 + \alpha x + 1$$ This
polynomial also factors in $$\textbf{GF}(16)$$ with our primitive root
$$\alpha$$[^23] as such. $$\sigma(x) = (1+x)(1+\alpha^6)(1+\alpha^{12}x)$$
This factorization allows us to see that the factors of this equation
are $$1=\alpha^0, \alpha^9 = \alpha^{-6}$$, and $$\alpha^3 = \alpha^{-12}$$.

These powers of these inverses in fact correspond to error positions as
such:

Root of $$\sigma(x)$$ Inverse of root Negative of power Corresponding polynomial

---

           $$1$$             $$\alpha^0$$             $$0$$                    $$1$$
       $$\alpha^9$$         $$\alpha^{-6}$$           $$6$$                   $$x^6$$
       $$\alpha^3$$        $$\alpha^{-12}$$          $$12$$                  $$x^{12}$$

These terms are identical to the terms of the error polynomial
$$e(x) = x^{12} + x^6 + 1$$. To the receiver, who has just calculated this
error polynomial for him/herself, the corresponding bits (12th, 6th, and
1st) are flipped[^24] to recover the original message. The final step is
completed by adding the two vectors/polynomials[^25].

---

         Received $$r(x)$$         $$x^{14} + x^{11} + x^8 + x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$$
       **** $$e(x)$$ vector                           $$x^{12} + x^6+ 1$$

Original $$m(x)$$ message $$t$$ $$x^{14} + x^{12} + x^{11} + x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x$$

---

## Summarizing our results

---

          Received $$r$$ vector           101001001111
            **** $$e$$ vector            001000001000001

Computed original $$m$$ message $$t$$ 101001001111

---

Now, the original message is the first five bits 10110. This message has
been recovered, without error, due to this implementation of a BCH code.
The information rate for this $$(15, 5, 7)$$BCH code is

The decoding and error correction segment of this algorithm is
essentially a way to find the BCH code word that has a minimum distance
to the received vector $$r$$. This code word (in the set of BCH code
words) then must be the intended sent code word before an error acted
upon it.

# Conclusion

Through our example of a BCH code, we required that calculations take
place in $$\textbf{GF}(16)$$ and with codewords expressed in binomial
coefficients in $$\mathbb{B}$$. Reed-Solomon codes drop this last
condition and allow the terms our message to be expressed in
$$\textbf{GF}(16)$$. As such, Reed-Solomon codes are considered a special
subset of BCH codes. Such Reed-Solomon codes are used in most CD
players, QR-code readers, and even in communication between NASA and it
Voyager deep-space probes.

For example, our example of a 5-bit message ($$10110$$)is not longer
constrained to 0s and 1s. Now, we can send messages in the set
**GF**(16). Conveniently, data in computers is commonly represented in
hex-code (in base 16) so we can send a string of data with 16 times more
information!

In this paper, we have discussed Coding Theory, finite/Galois fields
(and their various properties), polynomial arithmetic in these fields,
and a complete example of BCH codes.
