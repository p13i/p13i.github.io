# Achievements

- Won competition of dozens of teams & six semifinalists,
  presented to venture capitalists
- Identified an underserved market need in need for a real &
  permanent solution
- Co-founded a startup (GoSafely, LLC) that has now raised
  over $20,000 in funding
- Users slide open and press the shielded blue button.
  Pressing the button once alerts friends and family.
  Pressing the button twice alerts local police through
  Wi-Fi or a cellular network.
- The device can be added to a keychain for discrete and
  easy access in times of emergency.
- We prototyped the plastic casing and internal electronics
  within the two day hackathon.

# Mobile app

- Users can manage their Safely tags from their mobile
  phones via Bluetooth.
- Users can also trigger a more specific safety warning
  (e.g. EMS) from their mobile app. After an event is
  triggered, interested parties can track a user’s location
  in real-time.
