Unix has a command `touch` which is commonly used to create
files. Let's create a Python program with similar
functionality that can be called as if it were a built-in
Unix command.

---

# `pytouch`

Here begins the story of our CLI tool `pytouch`. For
simplicity, let's let `pytouch` only take one argument
`filename`.

When we enter `pytouch sample.txt`, we should expect to
create a new file called `sample.txt`. If such a file
already exists, we'll truncate it.

## Installation method

We'll Python's in-built `setuptools` to allow our tool to be
installed with `pip`, the standard package management tool
for Python.

## Python version compatibility

When we distribute a command line tool like this, we only
know that our user has installed Python; we don't know what
version of Python is installed or what packages are
available to us. We'll use `tox` to ensure that our tool can
run on several different machines.

## Directory structure

Let's create a directory called `pytouch-tool` which will
house all of our code. Create files until your folder
structure looks like:

```
pytouch-tool
+-- pytouch
|   +-- __init__.py
|   +-- pytouch.py
+-- setup.py
```

### Inside `pytouch/pytouch.py`

This file will contain the `main` method of our tool. It'll
handle parsing the one `filename` argument and creating that
file in the current working directory. Add this to
`pytouch/pytouch.py`:

``` python
import sys

def main():
    # sys.argv[0] is the path to the python interpreter
    # sys.argv[1] should contain the name of the file we want to create
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        raise ValueError("Please provide the name of the file to create.")

    filename = sys.argv[1]

    # 'w+' erases the file if it exists and creates it if the file doesn't exist
    with open(filename, 'w+'):
        pass
```

I hope this code is pretty self explanatory.

### Inside `pytouch/__init__.py`

We'll keep this file blank. This is just Python's way of
knowing that it should treat the containing `pytouch` folder
as a Python package. It's important to treat the `pytouch`
directory as a package as we'll see next.

### Inside `setup.py`

We're going to fill out this file so that we can use `pip`
to simply install this package. Add the following to
`setup.py`:

``` python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    # The name of our pip package
    name='pytouch',
    # The Python packages in this project
    packages=[
        # This is the `pytouch` folder that contains __init__.py and pytouch.py
        'pytouch',
    ],
    version="0.0.1",
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            # We use this line to map our `main()` method in pytouch.py
            # to a shell command `pytouch`
            'pytouch = pytouch.pytouch:main',
        ],
    },
)
```

Learn more about the `setuptools` package [here](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html).

## Installation

Go to the root of our project, the `pytouch-tool` directory.
`pip` documentation tells us that we can run `pip install .`
to install our package. You should see output like

```
Processing /path/to/pytouch-tools
Installing collected packages: pytouch
  Running setup.py install for pytouch ... done
Successfully installed pytouch-0.0.1
```


Now, if you run `pip freeze | grep pytouch`, you should see our tool!

```shell
$ pip freeze | grep pytouch
...
pytouch==0.0.1
...
```

## Running `pytouch`

Take 'er for a spin!

```shell
$ pytouch sample.txt
$ ls
...
sample.txt
...
```

## Un-installation

Run `pip uninstall pytouch` and our tool is removed.

# Further Steps

In a soon to come future post, we'll dive into testing tools
that will ensure our project can work with any version of
Python. **2017/07/16 Edit**: See [Testing Python
Packages](/writing/py-test/).
