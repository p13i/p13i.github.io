During my internship at Cisco, I led two full-time employees
where we created a highly-scalable distributed HTTP load
testing framework. We built a simple-to-use RESTful API that
would manage and orchestrate thousands of Docker containers.
An easy-to-use front-end, written with AngularJS, would
allow QA Engineers to select a JMeter configuration file to
run across hundreds of worker Docker containers running
JMeter. Log files were collected and analyzed on an
Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana (ELK) stack.

This project required 3.5k lines of clean well-documented
Python, a complete AngularJS front-end involving 1.1k lines
of TypeScript, and 0.5k lines of HTML.

Our solution was deployed to customers like AT&T and Comcast
to the scale of 100k+ users.
