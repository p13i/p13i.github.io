# Problem identified

Managing the evaluation of poster sessions and design expos
is a logistical nightmare. Collecting and processing
paper-based evaluation sheets is long, laborious, and
error-prone. There are dozens of such poster sessions and
expos at Georgia Tech every year, including the tri-annual
Capstone Design Expo for all graduating engineering
students.

# Solution created

I led the development of a highly-automated and
highly-customizable system for collecting information about
judges and presenting teams/students. We developed
comprehensive integration with email systems, automating
various email-related processes typically done by hand or
through Eventbrite. We also provide on-the-fly
visualizations and raw Excel values for team evaluations in
a fraction of a second, allowing for rapid evaluation. We
utilized all key components of the standard Django web
framework including the Django REST framework. This project
utilized many different skill sets including:

- effective database-model design,
- RESTful API design,
- DRY use of Bootstrap by use of Django Crispy Forms,
- template inheritance,
- UI design and iteration, and 
- load testing to simulate performance under the use of over
  5,000 concurrent users.

For this project, I wrote nearly 10k lines of
high-performant and clean Python code as well as nearly 5k
lines of HTML, 1k lines of JavaScript/TypeScript, and 2k
lines of custom CSS. This project had to be responsive and
was design to be mobile-first.
