Submitted to the ACM International Symposium on Wearable
Computers, an academic conference with a 24% paper
acceptance rate. We were one of 62 accepted papers to be
awarded **Best Paper**

# Abstract

> Order picking accounts for 55% of the annual $60 billion
> spent on warehouse operations in the United States.
> Reducing human-induced errors in the order fulfillment
> process can save warehouses and distributors significant
> costs. We investigate a radio-frequency identification
> (RFID)-based verification method wherein wearable RFID
> scanners, worn on the wrists, scan passive RFID tags
> mounted on an itemâ€™s bin as the item is picked; this
> method is used in conjunction with a head-up display (HUD)
> to guide the user to the correct item. We compare this
> RFID verification method to pick-to-light with button
> verification, pick-to-paper with barcode verification, and
> pick-to-paper with no verification. We find that
> pick-to-HUD with RFID verification enables significantly
> faster picking, provides the lowest error rate, and
> provides the lowest task workload.
