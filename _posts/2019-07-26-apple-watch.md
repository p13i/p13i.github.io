This was a very fun project!

I'm also getting very comfortable with creating wire frames.
I recently learned how to work with Cinema 4D's render
settings to more easily save commonly-used rending settings
for later. Very useful.

I learned how to use the Loft object which creates a 3D
polygon mesh from a series of 2D shapes. It was the strategy
I used to model the wrist straps which puzzled for quite a
while. ðŸ¤”

My favorite part was modeling the text around the electrical
sensors. It was very, very difficult to get the Wrap
deformers for the text and straps just right, but the result
was worth it!

Of course, this perspective is pretty cool (don't mind the
polygons!).
