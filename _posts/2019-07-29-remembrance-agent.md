# Remembrance Agents

The concept of a Remembrance Agent (RA) was first outlined
by [Rhodes][rhodes-1997]{:target="\_blank"} in 1997 as a
system that would automatically present
contextually-relevant notes, documents, and contacts.

In 1997, it became more evident that the perfect memory of
computers could augment the evolutionarily-honed intuition
of humans. Computers began to take more and more of a role
in note-taking, planning, and managing contacts. However,
all this information was typically not indexed in a way is
useful to people; documents would need to be rememembered by
file name and needed to be scanned through file structures
when required. Rhodes sought to bridge this gap by
conceptualizing and developing a wearable RA.

Rhodes focused their work on wearable RAs, systems that
could live with you and help you live a more productive and
information-rich life.

# A Desktop RA

In this project, I implemented Rhodes' RA for use on any
desktop computer.

As I do not wear head-worn displays consistently<sup>[Sep.
2019 correction: I do wear Glass consistently now]</sup>, I
developed an RA features as it would be useful to me when I
typically do use my computer, sitting at a desk working on
emails or notes for class. I required integration with
Google Drive and Gmail as it was where I took and saved most
of my notes.

I didn't want to develop an API in the middle to minimize
the risk of data breaches and unneeded complexity. Instead,
I implemented a local-disk caching method that downloaded
plain-text emails and documents that would then be indexed
and stored locally. As an additional feature, I implemented
a keylogger whose keystrokes would be recorded to a local
file for later processing and use (this keylogger only logs
keystrokes while the RA is active).

## Usage

Usage is streamlined for non-technical users. No knowledge
of programming of editing of config files is required. A
simple GUI presents all the features and settings you'd need
to use:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13140065/178388891-897cb7d0-e510-46f3-99b2-01795bee251e.png)

As you type, [every five
seconds][ra-query-period]{:target="\_blank"} the prior 60
characters of your keyboard buffer are sent to the RA.
Suggestions are presented as clickable buttons. To the left
of each suggestion is the relevance score of that document
[accounting for contextual
factors][ra-engine-github]{:target="\_blank"} like date and
subject of a document (these factors can be re-weighted in
the code as done by Rhodes).

The core algorithm used to determine the similarity between
two documents is TFiDF, or [Term-Frequency Inverse Document
Frequency][tfidf-github]{:target="\_blank"}: documents are
weighted by both the frequency of a word in a document and
the frequency of the word in the larger corpus of documents
(i.e. a "document database" in this project's parlance).

Upon clicking the first button (my meeting notes with
Professor Abowd at Georgia Tech), the RA client will open
the corresponding Google Doc in Chrome:

## Integrations

I use Gmail and Google Docs for communicating with everyone
and for taking notes on everything, respectively. For this
desktop RA, I needed integrations with Gmail and Google
Drive that did not rely on a third-party API developed by me
or others: I wanted a self-contained RA solution that could
be deployed in a single-click with minimal dependence on the
internet.

As such, a target Google Drive folder ID can be specified in
the GUI of the RA client:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13140065/178388890-d6b70d45-1ac0-42e9-a3f6-8721f6ff7248.png)

In addition, a maximum number of Gmail emails to index can
be specified. All authentication is taken care of
automatically by the Gmail and Google Drive API client
libraries.

## Caching

Querying Google's Gmail and Drive APIs upon every restart
would be computationally, network-wise, and time-wise
extremely expensive. As such, upon requesting that the
caches are invalidated, emails and documents are downloaded
from Google and stored as plain text documents on disk.
Reading from disk upon restarts is much faster than reading
from online. Metadata about each file is also stored in a
special `~metadata.json` file in the specified cache
directory. I opted that this directory (and the one
containing the `keylogger.log`) be synced to Google Drive
through Google's Backup and Sync utility.

## Performance considerations

When architecting and implementing the library package
`remembrance-agent`, I wanted to ensure that it would be
memory and CPU efficent so it could be run on hardware like
Google Glass. On such a small wearable platform, CPU clock
speeds are measured in the hundreds of megahertz and RAM
sizes are measured in the low single-digit gigabytes.
Further, over-heating is a constant concern on such
platforms.

As such, used performance analysis tools like

## Installation & Running

Usage and installation should be easy. As such, I made the
process as simple as possible without use of a proper
installer agent (the project is not ready for such
formalities). In three steps:

1. Clone the project repository from Github
2. Build the project locally
3. Run the command `ra` from any terminal

Further instructions can be found on the [GitHub
README][readme].

## Architecture

I closely followed the algorithms and data structures
outlined in Rhodes' paper.

I separated the Remembrance Agent backend functionality from
the presentation functionality. This resulted in two
repositories:

1. [`remembrance-agent`][ra-repo]: This is a pure-Java
   (version 7) package with no dependencies that implements
   the "engine" of the RA. It provides an easy-to-use
   [interface][ra-interface] for setting up and querying an
   RA. It comes with a few standard databases implemented,
   including one that will index a choosen directory of your
   local disk.
2. [`remembrance-agent-desktop`][ra-desktop]: This package
   uses the `remembrance-agent` package as a dependency. It
   provides a Java Swing-based GUI for the RA. It implements
   a Google Drive- and Gmail-based document database as well
   as usage of our keystrokes or speech as input to the RA.
