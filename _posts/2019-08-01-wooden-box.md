I then cut out the box-forming edge pattern for the box
using [MakerCase.com](https://en.makercase.com/) and a
friend's name in cursive from Adobe Illustrator. Both of
these components need to cut through the wood completely for
clean edges. The intention of the engraved signature is be
able to glow a name outwards when light is shown inside the
box.

I carefuly glued the box together with wood glue while
leaving one edge open. Note the whole in the top of the lid,
used for removing the cover.
