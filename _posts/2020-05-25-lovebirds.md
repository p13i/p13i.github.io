i saw two love birds today  
perched on a hill among the rolling greens of our shire  

you and i came to mind  
how we’d chat and mingle like the best of friends  

but we’re not friends, i don’t want us to be friends  
and that’s the problem  

but you don’t even know me, you don’t even care to  
and that’s the problem

we talked for a few months online,  
and as i knew you i forget you too, quickly

screen from which we met,  
screen from which we depart

love birds on a hill? no chance  
friends who fell in love? no chance  
will i ever even hear your voice? no chance  

i don’t know how,  
i don’t know if it’s even in my cards  

it’s all in my head,  
i expect too much	 

yeah, and that’s the problem
