I just completed an analysis of all my working hours this
past quarter starting on March 23rd through June 12th when
the academic quarter ended. My commitments throughout the
quarter included two [pass/fail
classes](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/03/26/spring-classes-to-be-graded-on-satisfactory-no-credit-scale-faculty-senate-decides/),
work for the [School of Medicine's COVID-19
response](https://innovations.stanford.edu/wearables),
academic research with Stanford's SHAPE lab, and a few
personal projects here and there. Quite a few commitments!
And I'll get to what that meant for my actual performance
later.

First, let me define what I mean by work: I track meetings,
lectures, heads-down studying/programming, and reading as
work. I don't count emails, networking, and various house
chores in these figures. Onwards to the stats!

I worked an average of 5.34 hours per day with a standard
deviation of 3.29. My minimum hours of work per day was 0.35
hours with a maximum of 15.33 hours. I worked a total of 374
hours over the course of 70 days. Assuming a per-entry error
of +/- 5 minutes and given 608 time-tracking entries through
[this
app](https://memory.ai/timely/features/automatic-time-tracking)
given an approximate error to the total account of +/- ~50.7
hours. Accordingly, I can approximate the daily error in
logged time to be about +/- 13.5%. Given the way I logged my
hours (using Timely's open-window tracker and logging
entries at the end of the day), this error rate seems
reasonable. The underestimates and overestimates inherent in
each of my time tracking entries lead me to believe that 374
hours of work over the quarter is an accurate figure.

This chart presents the distribution of work by "client" for
each day throughout the quarter. A "client" is an academic
course, employer, research, or personal projects. The
notable trends here are:

1. My hourly expenditure on the Personal Health Dashboard
   decreased significantly as my Computer Graphics class
   and Smart Products class took on more of my mental
   bandwidth later on.
2. I tend to procrastinate work on academic assignments
   until the few days before they are due. There are a few
   peaks that support this claim:

   - Sun. 05/03 - Mon 05/04 for Smart Products which were
     the two days before my first assignment was due in
     the class. There was almost no other work done
     during that time.

   - Thu. 05/07 - Mon. 05/11 for my Remembrance Agent
     project that a corporate client wanted a demo of. I
     spent three straight days on this project working
     about 10 hours per day to get this project to
     completion.

   - Mon. 05/18 - Fri. 05/22 for my Computer Graphics
     class.

3. The second half of the quarter was increasing dominated
   by Computer Graphics work as I struggled to complete
   the challenging assignments at hand.

Some conclusions:

1. In this Spring 2020 quarter, I seemed to work best by
   focusing on one task at a time and manically-hacking
   away at the problem.
2. I overestimate my throughput in terms of hours spent
   working per day. I always felt like I worked an average
   of 8 hours per day but it looks like this
   ‘manic-recovery' cycle actually decreases my
   productivity overall: after high-throughput days I need
   at least one day to recover where I only work 20-50% as
   much as the day before.

Having processed these data, I realized that I need to lay
out my priorities for this upcoming Summer very clearly and
make incremental progress towards those goals in a more
stable manner. With these data, I have evidence that these
mania-recovery cycles end up _reducing_ my overall
productivity.

Long-term, I definitely want my daily throughput to be
closer to 12 hours per day, 6 days a week, which over 70
days is 720 hours or ~93% higher than my current rate. (This
will include time for reading, creative projects, etc.)
However, long-term habits need to start with short term
goals. I'll start out with the goal of working a consistent
8 hours per day, 6 days a week which is 480 hours over 70
days, or a ~28% increase in throughput. Hopefully this goal
will involve less of the manic-recovery phases and more
happiness/stability overall!

I look forward to continuing to track my hours! I'm taking a
slightly-different approach to managing my tasks,
priorities, personal care habits, and time-tracking; I'm
using a simple spreadsheet for the coming months.

I'm so glad I have an empirical understanding of my
productivity and I'm glad I've been able to make some
important data-driven decisions about the way I spend my
days.
