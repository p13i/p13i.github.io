description: "Most applications that interface with a database are written with object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Many applications use SQL databases to persist data. There exists an â€˜impedance mismatchâ€™ between the use of object-oriented systems that act on objects of non-scalar values and the storage of scalar values (e.g. strings and integers) organized in SQL tables."
