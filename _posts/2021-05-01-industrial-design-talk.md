**Talk description**:

The products that surround us, particularly those that have real utility and 
beauty, draw upon a long history of industrial design. We will dive into the 
design style that characterized cities and homes through the generations. 

We’ll start with products from the Industrial Revolution (1760-1840) and end 
with the trends like Blobism and Deconstructionism. Practically, we’ll see how 
Apple Inc. has made use of blobism and neofunctionalist industrial design for 
products like their iPhone and HomePod. We’ll zoom out and see how the history 
of industrial design informs so much of the world designed for and by us.

This class will take a presentation form with frequent breaks for interactive 
brainstorming, filling out a Zoom virtual whiteboard, and sketching.
