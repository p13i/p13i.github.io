> People are in your life for a season, a reason, or a 
lifetime.

We hear these platitudes from our parents, our teachers, and
from many of the people that come into our lives. It's easy
to dismiss such sayings as trite or cheesy. However, what
I've noticed through my growth is that these phrases are
*True* to our human experience but require lived experience
(filled with mistakes) for them to gain stronger convicition
in our hearts: a conviction that can guide us as we continue
living our lives.

My friend, Indra, discusses friendship on his Medium blog.
His language on this subject has still been rattling in my
head for four years now:

> Life is a train. It starts at one station and ends at 
another. Along the way, you pick up passengers: your 
friends, and the relationships you make. Many passengers get
on and [off] at different points along the ride. Sometimes, 
they get on in groups and you stay in the same car. 
Sometimes, a passenger will stay there longer than others. 
Occasionally, a passenger stays on with you until the end of
the ride. [^sofian-2018-train]

Indra also writes about the feeling of reuniting with close
friends from your past:

> The saddest part, though, was during the dinner. For a 
fleeting moment, a single point in time, you felt what had 
once been. Maybe it was a laugh. A shared inside joke. A 
little action she made, or a classic move on your part. Like
a small ray of sunshine peaking through a gray sky. But, 
then it was gone, quick as it had appeared. The potential 
had been there, but there wasnâ€™t enough energy to start it 
up again. The friction, the energy it would take to make it
up the mental, metaphorical hill separating the two of you, 
was too great. [^sofian-2019-revived]

I went to a great high school in Bellevue, WA where I met so
many talented and driven kiddos. However, in the last few
months of senior year, I grew increasingly disallusioned
with the pressure cooker-nature of our accelerated IB
program[^interlake-ib]. When admissions results season came
around in March 2015, many of my classmates earned (and
bragged about) admissions into elite schools like Harvard,
MIT, Stanford, and the rest while I felt shortchanged with
only two admissions amongst the 20 colleges I applied to,
the University of Washington and Georgia Tech. Feeling
disillusioned with the admissions process, I cut off contact
with almost all of my high school friends. It was only after
college that I started to value these individuals again and
their interesting and diverse life paths.

When I reached out to many of these folks during my graduate
studies (now with four years of space from them), we would
get dinner, reminice about old times, laugh a little, and
all the rest. We would ask about how their college years
were and we'd give that 10 minute summary of our academic
struggles, mental health struggles, romantic struggles, and
the wonderful accomplishments along the way. But there was
always a feeling of "friction" made the "potential" of a
renewed friendship disappear as "quick as it had appeared."

One instance of this feeling: Two of my closest friends from
high school ("former friends" for a while but they didn't
know that then), wrapped up a few hours of online video
games with gameplay interspered with banter about our lifes.
After signing off, I said to myself "Oh, I wish we could
hang out some more, maybe in person back in Bellevue like we
used to do." That was the potential, tinged with sadness and
regret, but the feeling passed and I went on with my day -
as did they.

I've also had this feeling after a coffee with a physics PhD
student friend of mine, my psychology teacher from four
years prior, and on and on. Now, with my closest friends
from college also scattered around the US, the sadness still
comes and goes that we will never hang out like we used to,
playing board games and gossiping until 4am with all the
other shennanigans associated with college communal or
apartment-style living - memorable times.

High school was a chapter of our lives. College was a
chapter of our lives. Graduate school is yet another chapter
of our lives. The sadness of not being able to fully relive
old times with old friends is okay, and the sadness does
fade away too, seemingly exponentially over time (as with
breakups too). The limit of this function of sadness is 0
meaning that we may never reach that feeling of contentness
about a past well-lived or a past riddled with regreets, but
the feelings to lessen with time. *This too shall
pass.* [^hanks-2020]

To feel sad about physically-distanced relationships is to
be human. For most of our evolution in the genus *homo* we
have been highly communal, tribal, and nomadic people. It's
our working together in groups [^harari-2014-sapiens]
(together with a growing prefrontal cortex) that propelled
humans to the dominant status we enjoy in the food chain. To
be jolted into a new social context every few years due to
graduations, new jobs, or other circumstances is unusual for
our minds in the larger evolutionary history of humans.

(Side note: that's why I explored telepresence haptics
[^tangible-dot-team] through my startup venture, Tangible!)

Friendships are hard. They require *mutual reciprocity,
fairness, and a shared pace*. Beyond that, *time and
physical proximity* are most in developing close
interpersonal relationships of any type. In the dimension of
time, I've found that both the number of hours spent in
physical proximity and the number of days of silence are
important qualities of good friendships.

Why days of silence? We all need a break from one another;
in those times, our brains are able to digest the
interaction and gives us a chance to look forward to the
next encounter.

Friendships with women has been a constant tribulation for
me since high school, now over a decade ago! I've found the
words of Robert Johnson, a Jungian psychologist, to be quite
direct on this subject. He eloquently wrote about the unique
challenges of cross-gender friendships. He notes that
friendship between a man and woman is possible *only* if men
have developed mature relationships with the
"man-femininity" aspects of their psyche. He continues:

> Otherwise a man is certain to fall into one of the more
primitive modes of relationship with a woman, and the
friendship will prove to be one of these primitive exchanges
in disguise. Only a mature man is capable of friendship with
a woman. If he has that maturity, a most gentle and tender
exchange is possible with a woman. Some of the loveliest
moments of one's life lie within this province. There is a
grace, dignity, beauty, tranqui11ity possible between a man
and a woman within the structure of friendship that is
rarely equaled in any other dimension of life. Fortunate are
two people who know this kind of exchange. (Johnson
1994[^johnson-1994-lying], p. 57-58)

There's definitely quite a bit of psychological hogwash
sprinkled throughout Johnson's book but the eloquence of
this language has been a north star in how I view man-woman
friendships. With an empathic *yes* I can affirm that "there
is a grace, dignity, beauty, tranqui11ity" that is unique to
these cross-gender friendships but it requires maturity,
perspective, and respect.

Friendships between any two people can be tough, but they
don't have to be. When nurtured and taken slowly and with
grace, friendships can outlast romantic relationships which
can end with animosity and no contact. Friendships can
provide a perspective and a much-needed grounding in the
lives and struggles of others. Friendships can also wax and
wane over time, which can bring with it sadness and a
longing for a bygone past. And that's okay, it's only human,
so let's rejoice that we feel anything at all for those we
care about no matter where they may be.

> Friendships require mutual reciprocity, fairness, and a
> shared pace.

These words have stuck with me and continue to guide how I
look at the friendships I wish to cultivate and those not
worth the trouble. Finally, a note of optimism from author
Richard Bach:

> Don't be dismayed at good-byes. A farewell is necessary
before you can meet again. And meeting again, after
moments or lifetimes, is certain for those who are friends.
[^bach-illusions]

I wish you the best in adulting. ðŸ˜…
