Our mobile app was a checkpoint-based transit safety
application that allowed you to share your instantaneous
location with friends, share a transit route with friends,
and receive updates on your friends progress to their
destination.

Leading a team of four Stanford computer science students, I
conducted need-finding interviews that revealed a desire for
a non-invasive way to monitor friends/family during their
commutes or use of public transit systems. We utilized a
human-centered design process to rapidly iterate on our user
interfaces and design to best suit our project to our target
audience.

I was the lead engineer for the project and contributed to
our design. We implemented a cross platform mobile app using
React Native and Expo which provided real-time communication
and database services via Firebase. We made use of strong
software engineering design patterns and advanced mobile
application patterns.

We deployed our application to the Google Play and Apple App
Stores and earned a **Best Technical Achievement** award from
our course instructor, a world-renowned human-computer
interaction Professor teaching at Stanford University in
California.
