description: "CS 147 is a course on Human-Computer 
Interaction (HCI) and Design Thinking offered at Stanford 
University taught by Professor James Landay. These notes 
were prepared for the Winter 2022 course delivered in a 
hybrid format due to COVID-19. The course introduces 
principles for designing and evaluating user interfaces."

# Introduction

The academic field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has 
grown considerably in the past two decades as mobile and
desktop technologies are now used by and impact billions of
people all around the world.

This course synthesizes key research findings, provides
practical approaches to user interface (UI) prototyping, and
a strong introduction to the *design thinking* process
developed by the Hasso-Plattner Institute and Stanford
University to create experiences that are grounded in
observations of how real people use software products.

These course notes are summaries of key points in
pre-lecture reading materials and lectures including key
graphics and resources to better illustrate and aid in 
learning.

**Note from the author:** Please do note that these are *my*
(Pramod's) own notes and may not fully reflect the learning
outcomes of James Landay's course; howerver, I will do the
best I can to write an introduction to HCI faithful to the
teachings of James Landay and his wonderful staff of course
assistants.

## Pre-Lecture Readings

### [Stewart 2021] *From techno-optimism to techno-realism: What it means to innovate responsibly*

Stewart discusses how to innovate responsibly when building
for a diverse and global community, as Facebook does.
Unbridled technology-optimism isn‚Äôt a healthy approach to
responsible innovation, i.e. the belief that technology
advancements are always a net positive contribution to our
world. 

By leveraging a diverse set of perspectives, technology can
empower people and should be developed collaboratively with
the intended users. The technologies we deploy may
unintentionally reinforce or amplify the pre-existing
prejudices. 

In designing new virtual assistant voices, Stewart‚Äôs
Responsible Innovation team reflected early in the design
process to challenge the status quo that a voice assistant
should have a female persona and voice. This is a
socially-aware lens applied to development. 

Beyond the ‚Äútarget users‚Äù of a product, we should also
consider who would be impacted by others‚Äô use of the product
via an **expansive stakeholder analysis**. This process is
augmented by **codesign** wherein community members are
treated as equal collaborators in the design process via a
participatory approach. Participants were paid a ‚Äúmeaningful
honorarium‚Äù for their engagement. 

To empower people, reduce reinforcing existing societal
biases, and improve the condition of others, technologies
need to expand their scope of professional responsibility,
as a *digital urban planner* of sorts.
