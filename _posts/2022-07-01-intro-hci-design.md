# Introduction

The academic field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has
grown considerably in the past two decades as mobile and
desktop technologies are now used by and impact billions of
people all around the world.

This course synthesizes key research findings, provides
practical approaches to user interface (UI) prototyping, and
a strong introduction to the _design thinking_ process
developed by the Hasso-Plattner Institute and Stanford
University to create experiences that are grounded in
observations of how real people use software products.

These course notes are summaries of key points in
pre-lecture reading materials and lectures including key
graphics and resources to better illustrate and aid in
learning.

**Note from the author:** Please do note that these are _my_
(Pramod's) own notes and may not fully reflect the learning
outcomes of James Landay's course; howerver, I will do the
best I can to write an introduction to HCI faithful to the
teachings of James Landay and his wonderful staff of course
assistants.

# HCI & a Techno-Realist Vision

## What it means to innovate responsibly

Based on Margaret Gould Stewart's "_From techno-optimism to
techno-realism: What it means to innovate responsibly_".

{% include _single_download.html name="üìú [Stewart 2021] PDF from
    Medium.com (363 KB)"
    url="https://github.com/p13i/p13i.github.io/files/9128997/Stewart.2021.From.techno-optimism.to.techno-realism.-.what.it.means.to.innovate.responsibly.pdf"%}

Stewart discusses how to innovate responsibly when building
for a diverse and global community, as Facebook does.
Unbridled technology-optimism isn‚Äôt a healthy approach to
responsible innovation, i.e. the belief that technology
advancements are always a net positive contribution to our
world.

By leveraging a diverse set of perspectives, technology can
empower people and should be developed collaboratively with
the intended users. The technologies we deploy may
unintentionally reinforce or amplify the pre-existing
prejudices.

In designing new virtual assistant voices, Stewart‚Äôs
Responsible Innovation team reflected early in the design
process to challenge the status quo that a voice assistant
should have a female persona and voice. This is a
socially-aware lens applied to development.

Beyond the ‚Äútarget users‚Äù of a product, we should also
consider who would be impacted by others‚Äô use of the product
via an **expansive stakeholder analysis**. This process is
augmented by **codesign** wherein community members are
treated as equal collaborators in the design process via a
participatory approach. Participants were paid a ‚Äúmeaningful
honorarium‚Äù for their engagement.

To empower people, reduce reinforcing existing societal
biases, and improve the condition of others, technologies
need to expand their scope of professional responsibility,
as a _digital urban planner_ of sorts.

## AI & User experience design

Tesla‚Äôs autopilot feature requires UX design. The
touchscreen requires your full attention to operate it, a
mode ripe for multi-modal interactions involving more than
one interaction mode (e.g., voice with a screen output,
gestures to a voice output).

{% include _post_image.html
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13140065/180309680-ac8c1250-c611-4c16-9f0e-e31c61ae37c4.jpg"
  text="Image: [Roberto Nickson, Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/Ddjl0Cicdr4)" %}

Smart speakers use a voice UI but do not provide a natural
interaction with context and knowledge about the user. In
general, what should we show to a user? Who are other
stakeholders and what should they see from an AI system. Are
there design patterns to support smart UIs?

## Balancing design thinking & technology

A balance between human-centered approaches and technical
approaches in CS/engineering. Design involves:

1. **Humans**: the end users, cognition, vision, perception,
   motor abilities, etc.
2. **Tasks & Activities** we want to support for the people
   we are designing for
3. **Technology**: what users already have or new tech we
   might bring to them. This synthesis takes context in
   organizational and societal issues.

## Design discovery and exploring ideas

The **Design Thinking** process is outlined to the right.
Beyond a seemingly-linear process, there are loops or steps
back in this process.

{% include _post_image.html
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13140065/198849919-f4e708f5-cdd1-4ae1-aa84-c2fd17f1da9f.png"
  text="Five stage design thinking process" %}

User experience goals include:

1. Learnable: faster the second time
2. Memorable: from session to session
3. Flexible: multiple ways to do tasks
4. Efficient: perform tasks quickly
5. Robust: minimal error rates, good feedback so user can
   recover
6. Discoverable: learn new features over time
7. Pleasing: high user satisfaction
8. Fun

User-centered design involves:

1. Cognitive abilities: perception, physical manipulation,
   memory
2. Organizational/education job abilities
3. Keeping users involved throughout: developers working
   with target customers, think of the world in the users‚Äô
   terms

Accessible design involves catering to:

1. Different abilities: vision, hearing, cognitive, mobility
   (e.g., blind users with screen readers)
2. Moral and ethical purpose: inclusive design benefits
   everyone (e.g., sidewalk curb cuts)
3. Legal guidance: Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
   which includes websites and apps per the Department of
   Justice

Needfinding involves observing existing practices for
inspiration making sure that key questions are answered
including ethical questions in design with underserved
communities. Needfinding transforms into sketching and
storyboarding. Concept videos illustrate the context of the
user rather than the specific UI, a relatively quick and
inexpensive process that forces us to think about how the
user will actually use the app.

### Rapid prototyping & evaluation

Rapid prototypes allow us to build a mock-up of a design so
it can be tested, typically taking the form of paper
sketches or interactive tools like HTML, Balsamiq, Axure,
proto.io, Sketch, Marvel, Modao, etc. UI builders include
Expression Blend with Visual Studio, Xcode‚Äôs Interface
Builder, etc. Test with real customers (‚Äúparticipants‚Äù) with
an interactive prototype. Low-cost techniques involve expert
evaluation (heuristic evaluation).

# Design Discovery

## Successful Brainstorming

Based on Susan Adams's "_4 Steps to Successful
Brainstorming_" [Adams 2013].

{% include _single_download.html name="üìú [Adams 2013] PDF
  from Medium.com (355 KB)"
  url="https://github.com/p13i/p13i.github.io/files/9894489/Adams.2013.4.Steps.to.Successful.Brainstorming.pdf"
  %}

Adams found that most corporate executives put the cart
before the horse: ‚ÄúInstead of parsing the objectives they
hope to achieve, they direct their energy at coming up with
solutions to broadly-stated problems.‚Äù Keeney argues that
before brainstorming, it is important to analyze and focus
on the objectives of the group. Keeney‚Äôs four steps to
effective brainstorming are:

1. Lay out the problem you want to solve. Identify the
   objectives, evaluate the alternatives (pushing until five
   such alternatives are found), and select the best option.
2. Identify the objectives of a possible solution. Going
   into details about the requirements and not potential
   solutions makes the forthcoming brainstorming sessions more
   successful.
3. Try to generate solutions individually. Before heading to
   the group, brainstorm solutions individually to avoid
   ‚Äòanchoring‚Äô to a particular solution/objective to the
   exclusion of other goals for the team.
4. After the prior steps, work as a group. Use the
   objectives, problem statements, and individual solutions to
   facilitate a more productive brainstorming session.

## Beyer, _Contextual Design - Defining Customer-Centered Systems_

Based on Hugh Beyer and Karen Holtzblatt's _Contextual Design - Defining Customer-Centered Systems_.

{% include _single_download.html name="üìú [Beyer and
  Holtzblatt] PDF on my Google Drive (request access)"
  url="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bif2O_v-Q2MoPpNenZ7zosDeh52LLGE7"%}

Contextual inquiry is all about going to where the customer
(i.e., ‚Äúuser‚Äù or ‚Äúparticipant‚Äù) is, observing them, and
talking to them about their work. A relationship model
suggests that the appropriate behavior will manifest from
the right mindset applied to an interaction with a customer.
Different relationship models bring with them different
attitudes and behaviors taken to the customer. ‚ÄúAs long as
you play your role, you will pull the customer into playing
theirs.‚Äù

The Master-Apprentice Model is an effective way to collect
data on another. In this case, the design team wants to
learn about the customer‚Äôs work from its customers. The
customer (like a master) teaches by doing work and talking
about it while doing the work, making learning easy. We can
have customers explaining their work as they do it, but
customers may not be aware of everything they do or why they
do it. By having the customer talk through their process, we
avoid the ‚Äúhuman propensity to talk in generalizations that
omit the detail designers need.‚Äù By observing how multiple
such customers work, the design can begin to conceptualize a
system that supports those tasks. Taking notes and asking
about the artifacts in a customer‚Äôs environment helps the
designer gain more understanding.

Four principles guide contextual inquiry:

1. **Context** tells us to get as close to being physically
   present in the customer‚Äôs environment, allowing us to
   capture concrete data over an ongoing experience (in
   contrast to abstract data from a summary experience).
   Concrete data can be focused on by pulling the customer
   back to the real experience whenever the conversation
   veers off track. Grounding such questions in artifacts
   helps (e.g., ‚Äúcan I see that email you mentioned?‚Äù) which
   also serves to stimulate the customer‚Äôs memory.. Also,
   ask questions to fill in gaps in understanding.

2. **Partnership** is about making the customer and design
   feel like they are collaborating in understanding the
   customer‚Äôs work. In this process, the designer alternates
   between watching a customer and probing into their
   behaviors and environment. Such probes can also guide the
   customer to provide details themselves as the interview
   experience continues. Assumptions or potential design
   solutions can be proposed to the customer to clarify
   assumptions. Be a ‚Äúpartner in inquiry.‚Äù

3. **Interpretation** is the ‚Äúchain of reasoning that turns
   a fat into an action relevant to the designer‚Äôs intent.‚Äù
   Interpretation drives design decisions. The
   interpretation is grounded in facts, moves to a
   hypothesis which has an implication realized as a design
   idea. The apprentice can clarify their understanding of a
   task or structure by asking the customer directly to
   clarify. This approach helps the designer mitigate their
   own assumptions.

4. **Focus** helps keep the conversation focused on what
   work is relevant to the design without fully taking
   control from the customer. If the designer thinks some
   behavior is happening for no reason, then the designer
   doesn‚Äôt yet understand the point of view from which that
   behavior does make sense. Admit your ignorance, and
   always assume there is more to be learned.

{% include _callout.html text="If you think it‚Äôs for no
reason, you don‚Äôt yet understand the point of view from
which it makes sense. [Beyer, Contextual Design, p. 63]"%}

Beyer outlines a structure for contextual interviews that
Landay discusses in detail in lecture.

## Stanford d.school's _Empathy Fieldguide_

This PDF is a comprehensive book detailing how to get out
there and talk to people to ground product development and
design.

## Design Discovery

{% include _single_download.html
  name="üìñ Designing for People, Dreyfuss 1955, Google Books"
  url="https://drive.google.com/open?id=11hAc2-WbbzkHQ6upZel1MtLnEhqwWFuU"
%}

The design process consists of four stages: discovery,
design exploration, design refinement, and production.
**Design Thinking** encompasses the first two stages of that
process: discovery and design exploration.

In the first stage of this process, discovery, we aim to
understand our customers, their needs, and what they need to
accomplish. This process is also known as **needfinding**.
We aim to develop **tasks** that we can test using
**prototypes**. While understanding the design space
involving the end user, HCI affords us with tools to
evaluate existing products and the existing practices of
users.

The Design Thinking process consists of five steps, core to
the first half of these course notes:

{% include _callout.html
    text="Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test" %}

In the design process, we constantly find ourselves going
forward, skipping backwards, and in cycles of two or three.
In other words, the design process is messy and feeling lost
is a part of the journey. Let‚Äôs start with empathy.

## Empathy

Empathy begins and ends with another person. In this HCI
course, that person is the **user**. We begin the design
process with understanding the people, environment, and
technologies surrounding the user. To better feel what our
users feel, we aim to immerse ourselves in their world,
observe them and their surroundings, and engage with the
user. This process is based on _immersion, observation, and
engaging_ with the user.

[Malinowski 1914] is an early example of
**ethnography(-inspired) research **or **participatory
observation** (coined by Malinowski). During World War I,
Malinowski lived with the people of Trobriand Island fully
immersing himself in their world, their customs, their
practices, and their language. His technique was that of
**active observation** where we observe facts, make
inferences, state assumptions, and clarify our assumptions
in an intensive way. Critical to the needfinding process is
to observe and interview users without knowing what you are
looking for. The Design Thinking process lends itself best
to the mindset amongst its practitioners to **_discover
what‚Äôs interesting_** without bringing in agendas,
objectives, or (worse) solutions to a user. Therefore:

{% include _callout.html text="Needfinding is discovering
    opportunities by recognizing gaps or needs with a
    system." %}

[Universal Principles of Design, p. 76] describes such a gap
or need as a ‚Äòdesire line,‚Äô or _‚Äútraces of use or wear that
indicate preferred methods of interaction with an object or
environment.‚Äù_ Such preferred methods can form patterns
which require careful observation. When needfinding with a
user, we want to pay attention to all **artifacts **around a
user. Keep an eye out for hacks or workarounds users take.
Mistakes or perceived ‚Äòerrors‚Äô are a great place to find
needs.

The need finding process begins with questioning everyday
experiences. We move towards open ended questions to better
understand why a user is doing something in addition to what
they are doing. Further, we want to move from cataloging
observing actions to inferring (and confirming!) the users‚Äô
feelings, i.e., empathizing.

{% include _callout.html text="Engage users in their
environment!" %}

Imagine you are trying to better understand the eating
habits of a family. In addition to speaking with family
members, ask to get into their cupboard, ask to see grocery
receipts. Get nosy!

### Needfinding Interviews

A **needfinding interview** involves active listening,
empathizing, inferring, clarifying assumptions, and (once
again) _listening_ to users 90% of the time. Design
researchers should maintain an open mind and be prepared to
hear something new, change their own opinions, and challenge
their own prejudices and biases towards people and the
systems they use. As a designer, defer your agenda and seek
to unlock your users‚Äô world. Be curious. Step into their
shoes. Participate in their work. Ask probing questions.
Begin _tabula rasa_ and document their world with the
mindset of a beginner in a different world.

Strong interviews should be able to encompass a broad set of
questions but should always be prepared to veer in new
directions. In-person interviews in users‚Äô environment (in
their world) are usually the best: you can observe body
language and notice many more artifacts in your users‚Äô
environment. Video calls, phone calls, text conversations,
and surveys are progressively impersonal ways to interview
individuals.

{% include _callout.html text="Follow the emotion!" %}

It is advisable to see an interview as sharing the same
basic structure as a story. Namely that there is an
introduction, rising action, a climax, and denouement (or
‚Äòwind down‚Äô) to the conclusion. An interview shares a
similar structure as it progresses from closed-ended
questions to open-ended questions over time. Keep an eye and
ear out for emotion and pull further on those threads that
will evoke stories that bring out emotion in the interview
participant. (We prefer to use the word **participant** over
the term **subject** when working with humans.)

_Image: The structure of an interview closely follows that
of a story told in prose, film, etc._

{% include _post_image.html
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13140065/229276025-9eda8502-324e-4c70-b870-47bef2ce4468.png"
  text="Structure of a story as well as needfinding
  interviews" %}

An introduction of the researcher as well as background
information about the interview and study are important to
ease nerves and help the participant feel _comfortable_
sharing more about themselves and their lives. Interview
questions in this **background** phase can take on many
forms:

- Background: ‚ÄúTell me about what you do here.‚Äù
- Sequence: ‚ÄúWalk me through your day yesterday... then what
  did you do next?‚Äù
- Physical tour: ‚ÄúTake me on a tour of how you build the
  panels...‚Äù
- Virtual tour: ‚ÄúWalk me through your sales process from the
  beginning...‚Äù
- Participation: ‚ÄúCan you show me exactly how you prepare a
  customer bid?‚Äù
- Exhaustive list: ‚ÄúWhat are the different municipalities
  where you sell?‚Äù

After setting the scene, it‚Äôs important to still **build
rapport** with a user. Questions can take the form of:

- Naive outsider perspective: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not from LA, how does the
  housing market work here?‚Äù
- Changes over time: ‚ÄúHow are things different than they
  were last year?‚Äù
- Reflecting back: ‚ÄúSo, what I hear you saying is... is that
  right?‚Äù (clarifying an assumption or an identified feeling
  of the participant)
- Quantity: ‚ÄúHow many of your competitors fall into that
  category?‚Äù
- Tasks and organizational structures: ‚ÄúCan you draw me a
  diagram of your organization chart?‚Äù
- Native language: ‚ÄúWhy do you call your office ‚Äòthe command
  post‚Äô?‚Äù

During the rest of the interview, always be prepared to
adjust your questions to their previous answers. Ask
questions in the vernacular and language that your
participants use and understand. Ask for examples. Be
flexible:

{% include _callout.html text="Always be ready to follow up
    and pull on a thread." %}

During the denouement, shortly before the wrap-up to the
interview, **reflect** on salient patterns and interesting
findings, assumptions, or contractions that came up for you
during the interview process. A few guiding questions:

- Point to their reaction: ‚ÄúWhy do you roll your eyes when
  you say that?‚Äù
- Suggestive opinion: ‚ÄúSome people have very negative
  feelings about emotional sales pitches. What are your
  feelings about it?‚Äù
- Contradictions: ‚ÄúYou tell me you can sell ice cubes to
  Eskimos, but you also tell me you have a deep concern for
  your customers. How do these two work together?‚Äù

During the wrap-up, keep recording because some gems usually
do come out in this period.

{% include _callout.html text="People make sense to
    themselves. The job of a designer is to explain how
    things make sense to those people." %}

When choosing participants, we want to be representative of
target users. We also want to interview people on both sides
of an interaction (i.e., all the stakeholders involved). For
example, the Lyft driver and Lyft passenger. Experts are
good for background but aren‚Äôt a substitute for users.

Extreme users can reveal important insights. Extreme users
can vary in ability, SES, their interest in a topic, a
situation, or a behavior. Choosing people to include
implicitly excludes other people. We also want to see what
we can learn from people with different identities and those
who are historically underserved.

Ethical considerations involve power, language, standpoint,
and inclusion. Testing/fieldwork can be coercive if there is
a power imbalance (participants need compensation), power
imbalances can bias results (see [Dell 2012]). Language can
also replicate prejudices. Standpoints encompass the user
personas and perspectives of other users not immediately
evident to the designer.

Inclusion involves accommodation:

1. meeting interviewees where they are,
2. making people feel comfortable and safe leads to the best
   interviews and insights,
3. However, accommodations vary depending on who your
   interviewee is (signers for hearing-impaired,
   interpreters for non-native English speakers, etc.).
4. Be mindful of power dynamics.

Accountability within inclusion involves involving
interviewees in later stages of the design process and
constantly asking if our design addresses their needs and
wants.

Some caveats of user-centered design include politics, the
idea that customers are not always right, and that it‚Äôs easy
to get stuck in the observation process without prototyping.
Entering an environment as an ‚Äúagent of change‚Äù can cause
controversy. As such it‚Äôs important to get the buy-in from
all stakeholders involved. Customers cannot anticipate new
technologies accurately. As designers, our role is to design
and build systems that customers will want, not what systems
customers say they want.

{% include _callout.html text="Steve Jobs: A lot of times,
    people don‚Äôt know what they want until you show it to
    them." %}

With the design thinking process, we can get stuck observing
our target community forever without prototyping. As such,
rapid prototyping, evaluation, and iteration are key to
moving a design project into a usable product for the end
users.

# Define

Items ‚Äúabove the fold‚Äù are immediately visible to the user
on a website and should highlight the most important
information for the ‚Äúfirst read.‚Äù Alignment and white space
around buttons make them appear logically grouped (Gestalt
principles).

The design process has points for flaring and focusing. We
want to realize what is happening in our needfinding
interviews. We aim to realize new insights which help us
reframe the problem and find opportunities.

Observations lead to inferences which lead to insights:

1. **Observations**: ‚ÄúI notice...‚Äù
2. **Inferences**: ‚ÄúI wonder if this means...‚Äù
3. **Insights**: Actionable learnings about people.

A discrete observation (jeans on the back of the chair)
leads to a more abstract inference (millenials don‚Äôt want to
ruin their clothes meaning they won‚Äôt clean them). Focus is
found by writing a ‚ÄúPoint of View‚Äù - a unique, concise
reframing of the **problem** that is grounded in user needs,
insights, and emotions.

A four sentence structure:

1. **We met...** (person you are inspired by)
2. **We were surprised to notice...** (tension,
   contradiction, or surprise)
3. **We wonder if this means...** (what did you infer? need
   -- verb reflecting user needs)
4. **It would be game-changing to...** (frame up an inspired
   challenge for your team, not a reason or the need! Not a
   solution)

###### Example: Point-of-View for jeans user

- **We met** Chuck, a young millennial living in an
  apartment in SoCal.
- **We were surprised to notice** that he says he cares
  about his jeans, but he doesn‚Äôt wash them often.
- **We wonder if this means** that he believes the best way
  to protect his jeans is to not wash them.
- **It would be game-changing to** help him care for his
  clothes while keeping them clean.

A second example of a good POV:

###### Example: Joel and art collection

- **We met** Joel, a guy in his 20s with a good job and a
  new apartment.
- **We were surprised to notice** that he worried his taste
  was unrefined when the pieces he liked didn‚Äôt align with
  the more expensive prices.
- **We wonder** if this means \*\*that Joel views art as
  fashion on the wall: it‚Äôs about what his friends are going
  to think about his taste.
- **It would be game-changing to** help buyers to cut
  through the paralysis of doubt.

Affinity diagramming helps find important information by
finding relations between groups. Post-Its on large surfaces
work well. Empathy maps are another technique.

The ‚Äúyes and...‚Äù technique from improv helps generate new
ideas without judgment. (See [Ideate](#ideate).) At this
stage of **_Define_** we are still not focused on one
solution.

<!-- *Image: Empathy maps include observations from what
participants say and do, and move to inferences of what
participants think or feel.* -->

Point of views are synthesized from user attributes,
surprises, needs, and insights. A good POV has a few
characteristics:

1. It provides focus and frames the problem.
2. It inspires our team.
3. It provides a reference for evaluating competing ideas.
4. It fuels brainstorms by suggesting ‚Äúhow might we‚Äù
   statements.
5. It captures the hearts and minds of people you meet.
6. It saves you from the impossible task of developing
   concepts that are all things to all people.
7. It is something you revisit and reformulate as you learn.
8. It guides your innovation efforts.

Evaluating a POV is done on four dimensions:

1. Does your POV start by (1) focusing on one specific
   person and (2) sharing relevant context?
2. Does your POV present a truly surprising observation or
   quote related to a pain point?
3. Does your POV offer an insight about the person that is
   emotional and flows logically from what you learned?
4. Does your POV help you generate many ideas immediately?

## Eisenmann, Early Customer Research

{% include _single_download.html
    name="üìÑ Eisenmann, Early Customer Research.pdf (555 kb)"
    url="https://github.com/p13i/p13i.github.io/files/9986563/Eisenmann.Early.Customer.Research.pdf"%}

The goal of early customer research is to confirm that we
have found a problem worth solving before investing the
resources required to bring a solution to bear. This
involves generating and validating hypotheses about
**strong, unmet customer needs**, understanding the adoption
process, and ensuring the market is big enough to warrant
development.

[Stok] discusses a few forms of unmet customer needs:

1. Improvement opportunity: how far is the optimal solution
   from current solutions in performance?
2. Important: how much value would customers find from the
   solution? Is there a mandate for such improvement from
   compliance requirements or regulation?
3. Purpose: is the need utilitarian (addressing a practical
   problem) or aspirational (addressing unmet or unstated
   desires of a customer)?
4. Awareness: is the need for a new/better solution
   **blatant** or **latent**? Latent solutions may require a
   costly education component for the customer.

Barriers to adoption include switching costs (e.g.,
forfeiting existing contracts), lack of vendor reputation
(e.g., with startups), or the risk of customers abandoning a
product if it fails (again at higher risk for an unproven
startup without testimonials/recommendations).

Hypotheses of a customer‚Äôs problem take the format of **‚ÄúI
believe [customer segment] experience [problem] when [doing
task] and/or because [of constraint].‚Äù** A validated
hypothesis has characteristics such as (for blatant needs):

1. The customer confirms there is a problem,
2. The customer has already invested in trying to solve the
   problem, and/or
3. The customer has control over the space required to solve
   the problem.

Finding false positives for problems is a major risk.
Enthusiasts in a market space can bias solutions towards
ones that may not find mainstream adoption.

Biases in choosing research participants include convenience
sampling, only focusing on one-side of a two-sided market,
or focusing on too small a part of the overall decision
making unit involved in actually procuring and deploying a
product (especially relevant for businesses). Early adopters
will be the first ones to buy and use a product, and so they
should be studied, but mainstream viability depends on
understanding the needs of mainstream users.

Note: There‚Äôs a lot more content in this presentation PDF
about how to develop interview questions, different forms of
quantitative vs. qualitative research methods, how to
conduct an interview, etc. Many of the themes are similar to
_Beyer, Contextual Design - Defining Customer-Centered
Systems.pk.pdf_ but Stok‚Äôs presentation has a lot more
detail and examples. Stok discusses survey structures (p.
27), comparative/competitive analysis, user testing of
competitors‚Äô offerings, and developing user personas.

## Review on unpacking data into POV statements

###### Example: Really good POV statement. [Brackets] are my notes.

- **We met...** a young female [demographics] truck owner
  [characteristic], with an ME background [education], who
  loves owning her truck and learning about it [her
  passions].
- **We were surprised to notice...** she sometimes blindly
  trusts [say/do, surprise against ME background] whatever
  the mechanics say [behavior] so as not to reveal how
  little she knows about her vehicle [why that behavior].
- **We wonder if this means...** she is trying to protect
  [inference] her persona and confidence [feelings] as a
  truck owner.
- **It would be game changing to...** provide a detailed and
  accessible way [solution space, but not specific] for her
  to learn about truck mechanics in a style that doesn‚Äôt
  make her feel self-conscious [counters negative feeling
  from above].

## Ideate

Ideation is about building innovation potential via
brainstorming. We separate the idea generation process from
the evaluation process because pre-maturely judging ideas
can limit the creativity in a brainstorming session.

## How Might We...?

Versus ‚Äúcan we‚Äù or ‚Äúshould we‚Äù we start with judgment,
instead of an open exploration.

###### Example: A good POV: Janice with kids at the airport. [Brackets] are my notes.

- **We met** Janie, a harried mother of 3, [persona] rushing
  through the airport only to wait hours [pain point] at the
  gate.

- **We were surprised** to notice that she makes up many
  games to entertain her children [observation on
  do/behavior].

- **We wonder if** she is stressed [inference on feeling]
  that the kids will irritate fellow passengers if she‚Äôs
  unable to distract them [pain point].

- **It would be game changing to** bring other passengers
  and airport facilities [broad enough audience] into
  helping families [broad audience] have a better travel
  experience [broad enough goal for ideation].

‚ÄúHow might we‚Äù (HMW) statements for this POV can include
(see , p. 29), inspired by **_generators_**:

###### Example: Generators and example HMWs for Janice

- _Breaking the POV into pieces:_
  - HMW entertain kids? HMW slow a mom down?
- _Amp up the good or remove the bad:_
  - HMW separate kids from fellow passengers?
- _Explore the opposite_
  - HMW make the wait the most exciting part of the trip?
- _Go after adjectives_
  - HMW we make the rush refreshing instead of harrying?
- _Identify unexpected resources_
  - HMW leverage free time of fellow passengers to share
    the load?
- _Create an analogy from need or context_
  - HMW make the airport like a spa?
- _Change a status quo_
  - HMW make playful, loud kids less annoying?

A strong HMW question involves at least three of: who, what,
when, where, or why.

## Brainstorming solutions

It‚Äôs important to: go for quantity, not quality, when
brainstorming, to build upon the ideas of others (‚Äúyes
and...‚Äù), encourage wild ideas, write brief headline-like
statements on PostIts, do so visually, stay on topic, defer
judgment, share the stage equally, and **_stand up!_**
Having rules makes the brainstorming session more
productive: adding constraints to a session can improve idea
generation quantity.

## Selecting good problems & solutions

HMW statements generate ideas. Good solutions have frequency
(a common occurrence), density (many people experience
this), and pain (not just a minor annoyance) for users in
the market, and personal interest in the problem. The
ethical impact is also an important filter.

Voting techniques to down-select ideas include heat map
voting (two phase process), category voting, or picking
three favorites.

## Experience prototyping

We prototype to think and learn by **_testing
assumptions_**: we see how users see and feel the prototypes
presented to better understand the solution-user fit.

An experience prototype involves a scene, props, and roles
(including of the researcher), all of which should be
defined before a testing session. In the process we can find
new information about the user‚Äôs needs as well as new
information about how the solution addresses those needs.

Picking experience prototypes is a focus stage based on the
best/converged solutions. These prototypes should test a
part of an idea rather than an entire solution. It is still
a needfinding technique to test one assumption.

## Tasks

Tasks are about what a user wants to do, not how; they are
goal-directed statements.

{% include _callout.html text="A task is a structured set of
    activities or high-level actions required to achieve a
    high-level user goal." %}

Task-based design focuses on real tasks customers have faced
or will face that support the problem we are trying to
solve. Three forms of tasks are simple (common or
introductory or repeated), moderate, and complex (infrequent
or for power customers).

Focus on what a customer wants to do, but not how to do it,
which allows for comparison of different design alternatives
(i.e., different implementations to support the task). A bad
example of a task is actually a task flow (a particular way
of achieving a goal with a particular interface).

<div class="card mb-3">
  <div class="card-header">
    Example of a task flow, i.e. a <strong>bad task</strong>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">Tony clicks on the Charing Cross Pub icon and selects ‚Äúdirections to‚Äù as he walks down the street.</p>
  </div>
</div>

Tasks should be specific. These stories should be rooted in
facts, stating the customers (from POVs) and their
characteristics, filled out with all relevant details. Tasks
should describe a complete goal which forces us to think
about how features work together to support the tasks (e.g.,
phone-in bank functions).

<div class="card mb-3">
  <div class="card-header">
Example of a strong task
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Let my friends know where I am</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
Manny is in the city at a club that he wasn‚Äôt planning to go
to and would like to let his girlfriend, Sherry, know where
he is and be notified when she is about to get to the club.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

Tasks are described as **users and their goals**, not
details of the system. From simple to complex, the
_frequency, density, and pain_ (see [Selecting good problems
& solutions](#heading=h.5f0scbfwd3k8)).

<div class="card mb-3">
  <div class="card-header">
Example tasks for Lyft
  </div>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
      <li class="list-group-item">
<em>Simple</em>: Signaling for a ride
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
<em>Moderate</em>: Contacting drive to pick up a forgotten item
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
<em>Complex</em>: Become a driver for Lyft
      </li>
    </ul>
</div>

Token (a former project in CS 147), laid out their
_representative tasks_ as:

<div class="card mb-3">
  <div class="card-header">
Good tasks for Token
  </div>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
      <li class="list-group-item">
<em>Personal memories</em>: Create and share personal photos
and videos.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
<em>Shared experiences</em>: View content shared by your
friends.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
<em>Location discovery</em>: Engage with a location through
public content.
      </li>
    </ul>
</div>

Such tasks help us sketch out an interface design. In the
process, we can remove or add UI elements that specifically
support the tasks. Usually, at this stage, such tasks are
hand-sketched. With each task, we write out **_task flows_**
which lays out the step-by-step _performance_ of the task
(i.e., the how), illustrating what the customer has to do
and what they would see while completing the task. These
task flows can be illustrated with storyboards/wireframes, a
series of sketches showing screens and transitions between
those screens.

Unlike tasks (a high-level description), task flows are
_design specific_. By doing so, we can see how various
features will work together and they allow us to get
feedback via a visual demonstration from users. Having
concrete artifacts helps designers settle competing
ideas/conflicts and converge to better task definitions and
UIs.

## Video prototypes

Video prototypes _illustrate_ how users will interact with a
system. These prototypes can illustrate how users react to
them and how designers should fill out required details for
tasks/interactions. Video prototypes represent tasks (what)
and concept videos represent task flows (how).

## Concept videos

Like with experience prototypes, concept videos feature
roles (people involved), scenes (context of use), and props
(including the solution).

these topics are covered in lecture materials or repeated
from other materials so I will not provide more detailed

## Lecture

Exploring the design space of solutions following the
concept video. Such exploration takes the form of
brainstorming, sketching, storyboarding, and prototyping.
Elements of design sketches include:

1. ‚Äã‚ÄãQuick and timely
2. Inexpensive and disposable
3. Plentiful
4. Clear vocabulary. You know that it is a sketch (lines
   extend through endpoints, ‚Ä¶)
5. No higher resolution than required to communicate the
   intended purpose/concept
6. Resolution doesn‚Äôt suggest a degree of refinement of
   concept that exceeds actual state
7. Ambiguous to allow for more ideation

Design takes the form of a product. However, customers want
to buy an experience which involves the product and much
more context information (e.g., a bike vs. the biking
experience). User experience is the combination of the UI,
situation, and the experience involved. The object of design
is the experience. These sketches include only the elements
required to render the intended purpose or concept. More so
than eliminating details, we focus on specific details to
amplify those features that are most important.

Some parts of this lecture on design sketching borrow from
Buxton‚Äôs reading. Notes on this material will not be taken
again here.

## Values in Design: Talk by Dr. Diana Acosta-Navas

Values are underpinnings of the idea that we haven‚Äôt
considered before, and thinking about whether they are good
or bad. (See Stanford ENGR248 Principled Entrepreneurial
Decisions.) What can people do to embody those values? What
do these values look like, actionably?

The artifacts we design embed values of the creators
regardless of our intention. Our design decisions embed
values in the product and are expressive of what we care
about, including:

###### Listing: Examples of values in design

- Efficiency
- Privacy
- Beauty
- Truth
- Justice
- Equity
- Safety
- Transparency
- Accountability
- Inclusion
- Sustainability

These values emerge from the designer‚Äôs understanding of a
situation starting with definitions and specifications for
design features. Values also arise from user perception and
broader societal context (e.g., from politics).

We locate values by identifying key actors, writing a
functional description, stating constraints, and taking
input from the broader society. **Collateral values** are
those values that arise from design decisions, as side
effects. For example, in contact tracing apps, we may value
security, privacy, and autonomy. Security is addressed by
deciding where information is stored and the use of
encryption, e.g.

Values unintentionally crop up in a product via
standardization (who the standard user is), power, and
discriminations and form our default assumptions. Bias takes
the form of _preexisting bias (from community), technical
bias (from technology), \_and_ emergent bias (from
interaction with the system)\_.

A ‚Äústandard user‚Äù takes on dimensions of gender, age,
ability, race, zip code, access to technology, and needs
which can vary across an intended user base. It‚Äôs also
important to be aware of the distribution of the burden of
tasks (e.g., women cook at home more often), making it
harder for those people to use and actually benefit from the
product.

Abstract values are connected to design features via
definitions and analysis. Choices for inclusion of some can
lead to exclusion of others, e.g., changes made to
Microsoft‚Äôs Zoe AI chatbot. Implementing values involves
awareness of the narrative, intended users, context, etc.
and elements of the product expresses these values.

Having more than one value makes it inevitable for conflicts
between values to occur. These conflicts should inspire us
to make responsible choices in design. E.g., with contact
tracing apps we find a conflict between the best public
health functionality vs. the privacy of individuals which
require resolution via conscientious choices. We can resolve
these conflicts by dissolving it (finding a creative
alternative to meet all values desired), compromising
(prioritizing values), or trading-off (giving up on some
values for others).

However the framework of _values in design_ may not address
historical injustices and power relationships, but provides
a starting point for tackling these challenges. Other
complementary frameworks exist in HCI to aid in these goals.

# Visual Information Design

## Scott Klemmer lectures on visual design

Whitespace allows us to chunk information. Goals for visual
design are:

1. Guide people,
2. Orient people, and
3. Express meaning.

Color can be used sparingly as highlighting/emphasizing
elements of a web page.

The three basic elements of visual design are typography,
layout, and color.

We‚Äôre looking for perceptual balance even if the font is
implemented in an imbalance form.

Typefaces with a higher x-height are more readable on
websites, typically squashing ascenders and descenders. More
information is encoded in the top half of the text.
Expectation plays an important role in reading.

Leading is the space under a line of text. It should
generally be 20%.

### Good Form: visual hierarchy, layout, proximity, small multiples & space

<!-- TODO

<img src="images/image9.png" width="" alt="alt_text"

Prioritize the most important information. Strong visual
hierarchies can guide users into logical progressions by
showing what‚Äôs important.

The _Gestalt Principles of Perception_ help us understand
how to group information.

The first read is informed by size, color, layout, spacing,
and style.

Related information should be grouped together in closer
distance.

{% include _callout.html text="Only make things different if
you are trying to call attention to the difference!" %}

Small multiples of the same object can vary in one dimension
(say color) to highlight differences.

<!-- TODO

<img src="images/image11.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip">

<img src="images/image12.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip"> -->

Whitespace should be treated as an object. More whitespace
around a group implies that it is more important/valuable
information for the user.

### Good form: grids, type, graphic icons

Asymmetrical typography can make sites easier to read.

Grid systems can implement rationality, modernism, and
asymmetry without centering elements.

## Color

Information should not be ordered with hue because don‚Äôt
process colors in that way. **_Ordering by luminance is
easier to understand_**, while leveraging pre-existing
conception of colors (e.g., green for land and blue for
water on a map) which can have different meanings in
different cultures.

Color harmonies are pleasing arrangements of colors.

Minimize the number of colors used.

<!-- TODO ###### Image: Color harmonies
<img src="images/image13.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip"> -->

Complimentary colors provide extreme contrast and can be
quite jarring and are bad for text. Analogous colors are
comforting and pleasing yet provide enough contrast. Split
complementary colors are a good choice to start out with
because it‚Äôs hard to mess up. Active and passive colors can
be used to provide an isolation effect. Using three
actionable colors is a good choice. First design in
greyscale to scale and layout important information.

## Interesting design

Deviations should be intentional and point out important
information.

---

Other tidbits:

- Art of Balance: Promotion & demotion of important objects
- First Question for any design: what are the most important
  things?
- Information should be prioritized based on how important
  it should be when people see it.
- Visual hierarchy: guides people to look how they want in
  their own hierarchy.

# Heuristic Evaluation

<!-- Big Basket UI evaluation: hall of shame due to large ads and
bad colors schemes -->

_Heuristic evaluation_ is a 25 year old method that is useful in
companies and startups for testing software products.

In any evaluation we want to figure out what we should keep
and what we should improve or add. Lo-fi prototyping works well for
tap-and-show interactions, not real-time gestures required
for AR, painting, etc. They are not realistic in visuals and
performance, these are not an actual interface meaning that
we cannot let the user test it alone (‚ÄúHawthorne Effect‚Äù).
Participants can be hard to find repeatedly.

Jakob Nielsen developed the Heuristic Evaluation to help
find usability problems in a UI design. The key idea is to
take a small set of evaluators (3-5) to examine a UI to
independently check for compliance with usability principles
(‚Äúheuristics‚Äù). Evaluators only communicate after their
individual tests and aggregate them afterwards. Heuristics
are not laws but tools to help us find problems. We use
these violations to redesign/fix problems. This test can be
performed on a working UI or on sketches.

Good evaluators find both easy and hard problems. Every
evaluator doesn‚Äôt find every problem. These two factors
impel us to have multiple evaluators.

### Examples of values in design

  text="Example of a heuristic evaluation from class." %}

Here are some heuristic violations:

- Inconsistent colors for text (red vs. black) - H4
- Inconsistent or extra spacing - H4
- Price vs. total doesn‚Äôt make sense - H2
- ‚Äúh‚Äù value is accepted into the input - H5
- Yes and no are both checkboxes - H5
- Inconsistent highlighting of table rows - H4
- Black on blue text - H11
- Red font means different things - H4

### Summary:

1. Have evaluators go through the UI twice
2. Ask them to see if it complies with the heuristics, not
   where it doesn‚Äôt and say why
3. Have evaluators independently rate severity
4. Combine the findings from 3-5 evaluators, come to
   agreement

# Conceptual Models and Interface Metaphors

## _Design of Everyday Things_

Don Norman is one of the most famous HCI people. Started the
cognitive science group at UCSD. He worked at Apple, HP,
cofounded Nielsen-Norman Group, and worked at Northwestern
University. Currently teaching at UCSD, starting a design
lab there.

Design of Everyday Objects illustrates problems faced by
designers of systems. It explains conceptual models using
examples of doors, washing machines, digital watches,
phones, etc. The book includes design guidelines.

## Conceptual Models

This is also called a mental model.

{% include _callout.html text="A mental representation of
how an artifact works & how the interface controls affect
it." %}

People may have preconceived models that are hard to change.
E.g. ‚Äú(4 + 5)‚Äù vs. ‚Äú(4 5 +)‚Äù, dragging items to the trash,
etc. Interfaces should communicate the model, usually
visually or physical or using sound.

Affordances are perceptual clues. Well-designed objects have
affordances which are clues to their operation. They are
often visual, but not always (e.g., speech). Gibson called
this ‚Äúactionable possibilities.‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh visibility action buttons‚Äù

In 2015, the style of buttons changed into more of a flat
design in iOS. Text isn‚Äôt considered an affordance. There
was a trend in design from 2015 onwards to move towards flat
UIs.

Poorly-designed objects have no clues, weak clues, or
misleading clues. Signs are indications that a UI isn‚Äôt
communicating how to operate the interface.

<!-- ###### Image: In Hipstamatic, adding a rectangle angle and contrast improves the usability significantly.

<img src="images/image18.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip"> -->

Refrigerator example: solutions can be to (1) make the
controls map to the customer‚Äôs model or (2) make controls
map to the actual system.

There is a design model (the designer‚Äôs conceptual model),
the customer‚Äôs customer model, and a system image. Customers
get their conceptual model from prior experience & usage of
the new through the system image. Mismatches between the
designer and customer‚Äôs models cause frustration, bad
operation, lower performance, etc.

  feedback from Landay and a very experienced TA.

## Design guides for conceptual models

1. Provide good conceptual model: customer wants to
   understand how controls affect object
2. Make things visible: if object has function, interface
   should show it
3. Map interface controls to customer‚Äôs model: infix vs.
   postfix calculator
4. Provide feedback: what you see is what you get! (WYSIWYG)

Making things more visible. If it‚Äôs not visible, people may
get into a ‚Äúmode error‚Äù (on a watch) or may not see all the
functionality.

<!-- ###### In older car radios, the number of controls equals the number of functions. Controls are labeled(?) and grouped together. In the Tesla, we get no haptic feedback (and some voice feedback) mostly requiring us to look at the screen while driving.

Map interface controls to the customer‚Äôs model. Controls
should mirror the real-world.

## Interface metaphors

A metaphor is the transference of the relation between one
set of objects to another set for the purpose of brief
explanation. Lakoff & Johnson said that metaphors are ‚Äúthe
way we think, what we experience, and what we do everyday is
very much a matter of metaphor.‚Äù There are many examples in
our language. We can use metaphor in UI design to leverage
existing conceptual models.

The desktop metaphor suggests a conceptual model. It‚Äôs not
an attempt to simulate a real desktop but a way to explain
why some windows overlapped. It leverages knowledge about
files, folders, and trash.

<!-- ###### Image: From Englebart to Xerox PARC.
<img src="images/image23.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip"> -->

Example of metaphors include:

1. Global metaphors: personal assistant, wallet, clothing,
   cards
2. Data and function: to-do list, calendar, documents, find,
   assist
3. Collections: drawers, files, books, newspapers

How to use metaphor...

Avoid a metaphor for metaphor‚Äôs sake. Skeuomorphism is
‚Äúmaking items resemble their real-world counterparts‚Äù or ‚Äúa
physical ornament or design on an object made to resemble
another material or technique.

<!-- ###### Image: Apple iBooks2 looked like a wood bookshelf with books inside.

<img src="images/image24.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip"> -->

The iPhone‚Äôs click-photo is an audio skeuomorphism.

Arguments against skeuomorphism include that it takes up
space and leads to an inconsistent look. The argument for it
is that it helps people learn. You can include
skeuomorphisms until they are learned by the users.

However, metaphors can become dated.

<!-- ###### Image: The iPhone's phone icon resembles an older-style phone. The iPad Podcasts app included the tape metaphor most people didn‚Äôt understand.

<img src="images/image25.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip">

<img src="images/image26.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip"> -->

## UI consistency

Interfaces should be consistent in a meaningful way, for
example the ubiquitous use of the same keys for
cut/copy/paste. They should not be arbitrary choices.

Types of consistency include:

1. Internal consistency: same terminology and layout
   throughout the app
2. Consistent with other apps: works like MS Word, uses same
   keyboard conventions, design patterns (across many apps)
3. Consistent with the physical world

However, consistency is not always better. For example, the
Palm PDA may not have a new and delete appointment in the
same place, better choices were reflected in the Palm UIs.
Making for mobile may need more breaks from consistency.
Consistency helps people learn the interface.

# Usability Testing

## Why do usability testing?

We cannot tell how good a UI is until people actually use
it. Using heuristic evaluations with expert reviewers may
not be representative of the target user, i.e. they know too
much or not know enough about the target domain.
Additionally, it‚Äôs hard to predict what real users will do.

## Choosing participants

Picking representative target users can include job-specific
vocabulary, knowledge, tasks. We can approximate if needed
(e.g. doctors and medical students, engineers and students).
We can use incentives to get participants via a t-shirt, a
mug, or free food.

## Ethical considerations

However, usability tests can be distressing (e.g. users have
left in tears). Testing and fieldwork can be coercive if
there is a power imbalance (e.g., in under-resourced
communities).

As researchers we have a responsibility to alleviate these
issues with informed consent, avoiding pressure to
participate, letting them know they can stop at any time,
emphasizing that you are _testing the system_ and not the
individual (which is why we say ‚Äúparticipant‚Äù and not
‚Äúsubject‚Äù), and collecting information anonymously. In the
context of a university or a medical community, we need to
get human subjects approval (IRB).

## Designing & conducting the test

A usability test proposal includes the objective of the
study, a description of the system being tested, the task
environment and materials, participants and recruiting,
methodology, tasks, and test measures. With approval, we can
run the study and then use the procedures in the final
report. Writing these procedures can help us write the
report itself.

It‚Äôs best not to train users unless it‚Äôll happen in the
real-world deployment. Tasks should determine the best
design, not vice-versa. **Fragmented tasks** are those that
do not represent a complete goal a real person would do to
accomplish the task with our application.

Data can be qualitative (observations) or quantitative
(summary of what happened). However, quantitative
information cannot provide all the information, missing
emotion or the reasons for errors, etc. Bottom-line
(quantitative) results require many users to gain
**statistical significance**.

The ‚Äúthinking aloud‚Äù method helps us understand what users
are thinking, not just what they are doing (starting with
work from Herb Simon and Alan Newell: cognitive science and
AI at CMU). Prompts include:

1. Tell us what you are thinking.
2. Tell us what you are trying to do.
3. Tell us questions that arise as you work.
4. Tell us the things you are reading.

However, thinking out loud may not always give the right
answer which we can try to mitigate with broad questions
(e.g., not binary-answer questions). A responder bias is at
play where participants want to give an answer (e.g. panty
hose study). Accessibility is another important dimension of
thinking out loud because of different abilities of
participants.

We should only help the participant on aspects of the test
that we have pre-decided, keeping track of what people want
help on. We also want to record everything and take detailed
notes.

## Using the results

We want to summarize the data from a usability test by
making a list of critical incidents (CIs), both positive and
negative, which would include references back to the
original data. We strive to also analyze why each difficulty
happened. Positive indicidents help us preserve functions
that users liked while fixing the negative CIs.

Having collected this information, we want to see what the
data is telling us. Based on our expectations, did the users
engage as expected? Are elements missing from the
experience?

We rate these CIs and the ease of fixing those CIs so we can
fix severe problems and also make easy fixes.

## Experimental options & details

Situations where numbers are useful include time
requirements for task completion, successful task completion
rates, and comparing two designs on metrics like speed or
number of user errors.

Some measures are easy to record (e.g., time) but aspects
like errors or ‚Äòsuccessful completion of tasks‚Äô is more
difficult, requiring such definitions made in advance.

Combining thinking-aloud with quantitative measurements can
slow down the interactions.

Between groups, within groups.

# Experience Prototyping

Courtosey of Kristina Inoyue.

We want to focus on assumptions that are unknown to be true
and are vital for the user experience. These are the
critical assumptions to actually test with participants.

<!-- ###### Image: Two dimensions of choosing assumptions to test with experience prototypes

<img src="images/image29.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip"> -->

Experience prototypes are made to test assumptions to guide
future development. These tools are like running a
controlled study where one variable may be manipulated for
the participant. Future development is guided by insights
from experience prototypes.

# Accessibility

Courtosey of Jianna So.

_Social Model of Disability_

Ableism is a system of oppression that favors being
able-bodies/able-minded, frequently at the expense of people
with disabilities. Stacey Milbern.

Goal: collective empowerment and liberation is the goal.

Inclusive design practices:

1. assistive or ability based design for a specific task or
   ability
2. accessible/universal design, usable by most number of
   people

Social model => assistive

WCAG 2.1, A to AAA, ADA compliance. Netflix was suited for
captioning of songs:

POUR: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust

1. Perceivable: design for small screen size, use space as
   an element, account for zoom/magnification (lens under
   finger), color contrast: at least 4.5:1, best is 7:1
   (larger text with more spacing is more readable, allowing
   for less contract
2. Operable: keyboard control, touch target (9mm x 9mm),
   easily accessible buttons, non-touchable space around
   them, one hand vs. two hands, holding the phone in
   different ways, iOS height control
3. Understandable: consistent layout, position important
   elements above the fold, clear actionable elements, avoid
   dependency on font styling, include labels, instruction &
   hints
4. Robust: virtual keyboard, easy methods for data entry,
   avoid/minimize key entry when possible

VoiceOver design principles:

1.  ALL elements are reachable and labeled
2.  Elements have a coherent swipe order
3.  Label heading text with ‚Äúheadings‚Äù to help users easily
    navigate and explore the app
4.  Implement actions on interactable elements
5.  Add accessibility ‚Äúhints‚Äù to clarify and describe
    element‚Äôs role
