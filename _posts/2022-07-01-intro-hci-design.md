description: "CS 147 is a course on Human-Computer 
Interaction (HCI) and Design Thinking offered at Stanford 
University taught by Professor James Landay. These notes 
were prepared for the Winter 2022 course delivered in a 
hybrid format due to COVID-19. The course introduces 
principles for designing and evaluating user interfaces."

# Introduction

The academic field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has 
grown considerably in the past two decades as mobile and
desktop technologies are now used by and impact billions of
people all around the world.

This course synthesizes key research findings, provides
practical approaches to user interface (UI) prototyping, and
a strong introduction to the *design thinking* process
developed by the Hasso-Plattner Institute and Stanford
University to create experiences that are grounded in
observations of how real people use software products.

These course notes are summaries of key points in
pre-lecture reading materials and lectures including key
graphics and resources to better illustrate and aid in 
learning.

**Note from the author:** Please do note that these are *my*
(Pramod's) own notes and may not fully reflect the learning
outcomes of James Landay's course; howerver, I will do the
best I can to write an introduction to HCI faithful to the
teachings of James Landay and his wonderful staff of course
assistants.

# Lecture 1A: Introduction to HCI and a Techno-Realist Vision

## Pre-Lecture Readings

### [Stewart 2021] *From techno-optimism to techno-realism: What it means to innovate responsibly*

Stewart discusses how to innovate responsibly when building
for a diverse and global community, as Facebook does.
Unbridled technology-optimism isn‚Äôt a healthy approach to
responsible innovation, i.e. the belief that technology
advancements are always a net positive contribution to our
world. 

By leveraging a diverse set of perspectives, technology can
empower people and should be developed collaboratively with
the intended users. The technologies we deploy may
unintentionally reinforce or amplify the pre-existing
prejudices. 

In designing new virtual assistant voices, Stewart‚Äôs
Responsible Innovation team reflected early in the design
process to challenge the status quo that a voice assistant
should have a female persona and voice. This is a
socially-aware lens applied to development. 

Beyond the ‚Äútarget users‚Äù of a product, we should also
consider who would be impacted by others‚Äô use of the product
via an **expansive stakeholder analysis**. This process is
augmented by **codesign** wherein community members are
treated as equal collaborators in the design process via a
participatory approach. Participants were paid a ‚Äúmeaningful
honorarium‚Äù for their engagement. 

To empower people, reduce reinforcing existing societal
biases, and improve the condition of others, technologies
need to expand their scope of professional responsibility,
as a *digital urban planner* of sorts.

### AI & User experience design

Tesla‚Äôs
autopilot feature requires UX design. The touchscreen
requires your full attention to operate it, a mode ripe for
multi-modal interactions involving more than one interaction
mode (e.g., voice with a screen output, gestures to a voice
output). Smart speakers use a voice UI but do not provide a
natural interaction with context and knowledge about the
user. In general, what should we show to a user? Who are
other stakeholders and what should they see from an AI
system. Are there design patterns to support smart UIs?

### Balancing design thinking & technology

A balance between human-centered approaches and technical
approaches in CS/engineering. Design involves: Humans: the
end users, cognition, vision, perception, motor abilities,
etc. Tasks & Activities we want to support for the people we
are designing for Technology: what users already have or new
tech we might bring to them. This synthesis takes context in
organizational and societal issues.

### Design discovery and exploring ideas 

The Design Thinking process is outlined to the right. Beyond
a seemingly-linear process, there are loops or steps back in
this process. 

User experience goals include: 

1. Learnable: faster the second time 
2. Memorable: from session to session 
3. Flexible: multiple ways to do tasks
4. Efficient: perform tasks quickly 
5. Robust: minimal error rates, good feedback so user can
recover
6. Discoverable: learn new features over time 
7. Pleasing: high user satisfaction 
8. Fun

User-centered design involves:
1. Cognitive abilities: perception, physical manipulation,
memory
2. Organizational/education job abilities 
3. Keeping users involved throughout: developers working
with target customers, think of the world in the users‚Äô
terms 

Accessible design involves catering to:
1. Different abilities: vision, hearing, cognitive, mobility
(e.g., blind users with screen readers)
2. Moral and ethical purpose: inclusive design benefits
everyone (e.g., sidewalk curb cuts)
3. Legal guidance: Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
which includes websites and apps per the Department of
Justice

Needfinding involves observing existing practices for
inspiration making sure that key questions are answered
including ethical questions in design with underserved
communities. Needfinding transforms into sketching and
storyboarding. Concept videos illustrate the context of the
user rather than the specific UI, a relatively quick and
inexpensive process that forces us to think about how the
user will actually use the app.

### Rapid prototyping & evaluation 

Rapid prototypes allow us to build a mock-up of a design so
it can be tested, typically taking the form of paper
sketches or interactive tools like HTML, Balsamiq, Axure,
proto.io, Sketch, Marvel, Modao, etc. UI builders include
Expression Blend with Visual Studio, Xcode‚Äôs Interface
Builder, etc. Test with real customers (‚Äúparticipants‚Äù) with
an interactive prototype. Low-cost techniques involve expert
evaluation (heuristic evaluation).
