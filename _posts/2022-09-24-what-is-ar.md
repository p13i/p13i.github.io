In both research writing and popular press, many different
names are used to describe experiences that combines a
computer-generated image with the real world across various
senses such as visual, haptic, or audio input to the user.

Such terms include:

* Mixed Reality (Microsoft HoloLens)
* Smart Glasses
* Registered Graphics
* Extended Reality
* Augmented Reality

Many of these names were created by researchers or industry
folks out of the need to differentiate their product from
others on the market.
