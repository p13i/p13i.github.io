In both research writing and popular press, many different
names are used to describe experiences that combines a
computer-generated image with the real world across various
senses such as visual, haptic, or audio input to the user.

Such terms include:

* Mixed Reality (Microsoft HoloLens)
* Smart Glasses (static graphics)
* Registered Graphics
* Extended Reality
* Augmented Reality

Many of these names were created by researchers or industry
folks out of the need to differentiate their product from
others on the market.

With cheaper and more powerful mobile computers becoming
increasingly ubiqutous, augmented reality has already taken
a hold in the cultural zeitgeist. It's speculated that
Apple will be release an AR/VR headset in 2023, although
folks have been saying that for quite some time now.
