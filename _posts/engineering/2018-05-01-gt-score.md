# Problem identified

Managing the evaluation of poster sessions and design expos is a logistical nightmare. Collecting and processing paper-based evaluation sheets is long, laborious, and error-prone. There are dozens of such poster sessions and expos at Georgia Tech every year, including the tri-annual Capstone Design Expo for all graduating engineering students.

# Solution created

I led the development of a highly-automated and highly-customizable system for collecting information about judges and presenting teams/students. We developed comprehensive integration with email systems, automating various email-related processes typically done by hand or through Eventbrite. We also provide on-the-fly visualizations and raw Excel values for team evaluations in a fraction of a second, allowing for rapid evaluation. We utilized all key components of the standard Django web framework including the Django REST framework. This project utilized many different skill sets including:

- effective database-model design,
- RESTful API design,
- DRY use of Bootstrap by use of Django Crispy Forms,
- template inheritance,
- UI design and iteration, and 
- load testing to simulate performance under the use of over 5,000 concurrent users.

For this project, I wrote nearly 10k lines of high-performant and clean Python code as well as nearly 5k lines of HTML, 1k lines of JavaScript/TypeScript, and 2k lines of custom CSS. This project had to be responsive and was design to be mobile-first.
