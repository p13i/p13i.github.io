This was a business I pursued (mostly independently) from 2018 through 2019.

This work was based on our ISWC 2018 paper.

I wrote out a pretty complete 25-30 page business plan. The executive summary
is available as a PDF in the downloads section of this page.

I abandoned the venture because my research (involving many calls with 
industry leaders) convinced me that the return-on-investment (ROI) dollar 
amount and timeline, and the geographically-sparse nature of factories and 
warehouses would make this business difficult to scale exponentially 
(i.e. it would take ~20 years, like Ubimax which was aquired by TeamViewer 
after 18 years of business). 

I estimated that each factory or warehouse worker instrumented with a 
heads-up display (HUD), our integrated body-worn wearables, and our intelligent 
applications, would return only about $110 per month of cost-savings. 
That's about 7-10 hours **per month** of time saved, a very minimal amount. 
Plus robotics is getting pretty dang good and workers are increasingly 
demanding better working conditions (both of which are great!).
