With 4 years of research at Georgia Tech & Stanford, my focus includes HCI, wearable tech, AR/VR, & ML for health; winning 2 Best Paper Awards of my 5 publications. As President of Georgia Tech's web dev club, I organized meetings & outreach events. At Stanford, I was a TA for an entrepreneurship course, guiding students in projects & career goals. I'm eager to mentor for exploreCSR, advocating for diversity to enhance creativity in research & better align our community with user demographics.
