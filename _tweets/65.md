#NoContext I see, okay. My motivation for asking is that I've been drinking a lot these past few days in our family parties in Detroit. I've been feeling really sad that you are not able to enjoy alcohol and it's effects in a controlled way, i.e. I know I can stop drinking after this 'vacation' but AA folks really don't have that same feeling etc. :(
