# Problem identified

- Increased adoption of wearable heart-rate sensors opens opportunity to understand mobile health behavior
- Classification of arrhythmias and other heart complications saves lives and costs

# Solution created

- Pipeline to input, clean, de-trend, process, and fit ballistocardiogram (BCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms to Hidden Markov Models.

# Technologies used

- MATLAB + DSP Toolbox
- Python hmmlearn
