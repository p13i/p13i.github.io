# Problem identified

Managing the evaluation of poster sessions and design expos is a logistical nightmare. Collecting and processing paper-based evaluation sheets is long, laborious, and error-prone. There are dozens of such poster sessions and expos at Georgia Tech every year, including the tri-annual Capstone Design Expo for all graduating engineering students.

# Solution created

I led development of a highly-automated and highly-customizable system for collecting information about judges and presenting teams/students. We developed comprehensive integration with email systems, automating various email-related processes typically done by hand or through Eventbrite. We also provide on-the- visualizations and raw Excel values for team evaluations in a fraction of a second, allowing for rapid evaluation
