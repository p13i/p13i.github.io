Submitted to the ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers, an academic conference with a 24% paper acceptance rate. We were one of 62 accepted papers to be awarded **Best Paper**

# Abstract

> Order picking accounts for 55% of the annual $60 billion spent on warehouse operations in the United States.
> Reducing human-induced errors in the order fulfillment process can save warehouses and distributors significant costs.
> We investigate a radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based verification method wherein wearable RFID scanners, worn on the wrists, scan passive RFID tags mounted on an itemâ€™s bin as the item is picked; this method is used in conjunction with a head-up display (HUD) to guide the user to the correct item.
> We compare this RFID verification method to pick-to-light with button verification, pick-to-paper with barcode verification, and pick-to-paper with no verification.
> We find that pick-to-HUD with RFID verification enables significantly faster picking, provides the lowest error rate, and provides the lowest task workload.
