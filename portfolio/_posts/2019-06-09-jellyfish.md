This is definitely my best render to date. I learned a ton about modeling, C4D procedural deformers, and hair simulation, and texturing.

# Modeling

The first phase was modeling. I followed Motion Viking's [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11JwBQkzySE) to model, rig, and animate a jellyfish in a procedural way. _Procedural modeling_ differs from traditional modeling in that each modification made to the base shape without altering the original shape.
