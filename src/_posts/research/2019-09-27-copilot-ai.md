This was a business I pursued (mostly independently) from
2018 through 2019.

I wrote out a pretty complete 25-30 page business plan. The
executive summary is available as a PDF in the downloads
section of this page.

I abandoned the venture because my research (involving many
calls with industry leaders) convinced me that the
return-on-investment (ROI) dollar amount and timeline, and
the geographically-sparse nature of factories and warehouses
would make this business difficult to scale exponentially
(i.e. it would take ~20 years, like Ubimax which was aquired
by TeamViewer after 18 years of business). 

I estimated that each factory or warehouse worker
instrumented with a heads-up display (HUD), our integrated
body-worn wearables, and our intelligent applications, would
return only about $110 per month of cost-savings. That's
about 7-10 hours **per month** of time saved, a very minimal
amount. Plus robotics is getting pretty dang good and
workers are increasingly demanding better working conditions
(both of which are great!).

This work was based on our ISWC 2018 paper.
