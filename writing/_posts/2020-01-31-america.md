America

The beautiful babble of children,  
the wonderful, well-kept classrooms.  
  
Punctuated by the percussive sounds  
of rifle rounds in the distance.  
  
Children play in the fields  
their minds sponges for ever more.  
  
Men play in the woods  
their fingers itching for more.  
  
In this beautiful town nestled  
in a valley between two evergreen hills.  
  
Yet a tragic irony beats on  
that seems to quietly inculcate into our reality:  
  
The echos of gun shots seemingly smothering  
the innocent play of children.  
  
“NOTICE Gun Range in Area”  
that’s all they write, yet it speaks so much.  
  
This is America.
